## Background

Tandaleia was born to Bilben and Galtina Deleamintaviglia and lived an all around happy life. She caught the gambling bug at an early age and eventually her debts caught up to her. The only way to escape her debtors was through service to the church, so she joined. In her 2nd year of Acolyte study, Tandaleia showed a real penchant for trickery and living dangerously. It was exactly this kind of behavior that garnered Tandaleia the favor of Tymora, goddess of fortune.
