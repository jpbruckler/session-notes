>[!quote]
>Little of value was in the building. On [[Frukar Excelar|Frukar]]â€™s body was found a key to the front door and a diamond worth 100 gp. In his room was found a diamond worth 300 gp, a letter that congratulated him on becoming a [[Knight of the Night]], and a black bound leather book with a skull ornament with eyes that seem to follow you. The ink writing in the book is a mix of unreadable glyphs, inscriptions, and shorthand notes.
