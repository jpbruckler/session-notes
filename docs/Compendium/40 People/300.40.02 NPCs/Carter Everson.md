# Carter Everson

FactionMember::  
LastLocation::[[Everson Estate]]


## Notes

* [[Elinor]] and [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]] approached the guard, convinced him to get the steward, who agreed to take [[Elinor]] alone to see Carter Everson.
* Carter’s wife, Rhonda, received a small inheritance from her grandfather who was an adventurer. It may have contained the [[Penetration Stone]]. However, that portion of the basement is sealed off behind an Arcane Lock because it is infested with undead.
* Carter Everson said the party could have the [[Penetration Stone]], if it is there, so long as they clear out the undead.
