# Auntie Caustic

## Notes

- She is a fiend, confirmed with [[Spells Z#Zone of Truth]] by [[Elinor]]
- Seems to be the cause of [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]'s headaches. Provided [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] with a circlet that was meant to prevent the headaches, but we confirmed with [[Booster]] that the circlet was non-magical
