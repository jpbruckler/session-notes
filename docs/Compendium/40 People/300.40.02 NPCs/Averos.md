# Averos

## Notes

> [!quote]+
> Fine, thank you. I appreciate each of your candor [to the degree that you showed it]. As I said, [[SLD]] has objectives. They primarily involved the collection and use of knowledge. We subsist by selling some of what we learn, especially to make leaders make better decisions. We also oppose some aggressive necromancy. Most of our collection efforts are done on contract or by partners. We are looking for a new team to work with. There is a weapon believed to be to the north of here that we desire. I think you may be the team to collect it. If accepting of the contract, there are two ways to do it.
>
> The first, would be a simple transaction. I tell you what I am looking for and where, or how, to find it. You are committed to retrieving it and returning it to the [[SLD]]. You will be paid for the device; not market price but we are providing information and not sending a competing team. The information is valuable so proper consideration must be made, but generally if you can’t finish the job then that is what it is. But once you get your hands on the device, you must return it to us. The information is our down payment.
>
> The second option is a collaboration. You collect the item, but we also provide support. For example, some healing may be made available to you but 10% of the value of your spoils go to the [[SLD]]. These relationships usually are longer term because they benefit both parties so well. Our employees often come from these relationships. But it is rare for a portion of a team to be collaborative and a portion to be transactional; it just doesn’t work out.
