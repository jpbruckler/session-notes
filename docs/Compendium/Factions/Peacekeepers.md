## Description

The [[Aimesland]] Peacekeepers is the force that respond to criminal acts and maintains order. They are recognizable by a dark blue tunic with an emblem of an ivory star in a golden circle. Peacekeepers generally let the populace act with a lot of freedom, however activities that take advantage of others or inhibit the liberties of others are not taken lightly.

The Peacekeepers are the federal law enforcement organization of [[Aimesland]]. [[Aimesland]] emphasizes individual rights, so the federal government defers to local government a lot. But you could think of the Peacekeepers sort of as the FBI in America. If the local government doesn't have resources, an issue extends beyond its authority, or the local government is committing the crime (corruption), the Peacekeepers would become involved. 

[[Alex]] could have become involved in the murder investigations if constable [[Krisvyre]] didn't handle them correctly because the prohibition against murder is an [[Aimesland]] law as well as a local rule, but they don't infringe on local matters unless necessary.
