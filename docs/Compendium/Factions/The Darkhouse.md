## Description

The Church (as in, the whole religion) is headed by a Bishop (larger religions may have a Pope and multiple Bishops). The Bishop is always a religious type (i.e. Cleric) rather than a rogue type (i.e. rogue). A church has a high priest/guildmaster in charge. Leaders/clergy run the church and perform sermons.

- Clergy are typically priest (stat-block), clerics, or rogues. 
- Templars defend the church and may be assigned to support personnel outside of the “house” with might. Templars are typically veterans (stat-block), bandits (stat-block), fighters, rangers, or rogues. 
- Freedom Operatives (FOp) specialize in the secretive work of the church whether that is collecting information, supporting freedom & privacy, espionage, sabotage, or infiltrating those that would do them harm. Some financial support is gained by stealing from those who have extra, breaking up ruffians who prey on the community (and taking their stuff as a fee), and protection networks (i.e. a less oppressive form of racketeering). FOp are typically rogues or bards, although some “houses” seem to attract FOp sorcerers. 

A significant portion of the churches expenses involve maintaining member’s covers (money that goes into the community) and direct community support. 

[[The Darkhouse]] is a church to [[Sutamo]]. His church is a secretive organization. Although the Church is not highly structured, they are very loyal to their cult-like organization. It is frequented by a diverse mix of races and classes, although many consider it to be a band of thieves. However, they tend to be much more focused on supporting freedom than defeating law. [[The Darkhouse]] is led by a human Bishop ([[Ramon]]). 

The clergy includes 5 priests and 2 deacons. 

The militia for [[The Darkhouse]] includes

- 1 FP (Freedom Protector) 
- 1 Captain of the [[Protectorate]]
- 3 Watch Organizers (Sergeant who makes the enforcer assignments)
- 6 honor guards, and 
- 1 enforcers. 

Special operations are performed by the 9 Freedom Operatives (FOp), primarily rogues and rangers. 

There are 87 members of the church, 42 of which are active members. Members possess a non-descript jet black onyx necklace to identify themselves.

Beliefs: 
- Darkness enhances privacy 
- We have an obligation to fight oppression, large and small 
- Freedom/liberty is the paramount principle 
- Acting openly may cause targeting by oppressive forces or corruption by prideful individuals
