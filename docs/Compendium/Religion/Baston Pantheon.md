**Mechanics of the system**

Pantheon selection

Two aspects of the Finnish mythos made it the basis of my system. First, the Kalevala was very hero-centric work. Also, it was displaced in a mere 70 years of formal writing. While there was a wealth of material, it was not overwhelmingly so. This allowed me to flesh out the D&D mythos with historical gods, spirits, 3 gods from other mythos, and a few strictly fictitious godlings without contradicting well known beliefs.

Ascension

There is an ascension system in the religious system. The “gods,” more accurately described as deities, are made up of 3 levels of gods (greater god, lesser god, and demigod), 3 levels of godlings (higher godling, lower godling, and quasidiety), and 2 levels of heros (major and minor). Within each level, there are ranks. Beings gain power as they gain ranks. Ranks or generally gained by obtaining worshippers, believers, and followers.

A godling is typically associated with a god that augments their ability to grant spells to their clerics. Heros cannot grant spells although their power can greatly exceed that of mortal men and women. There are no deities that originated on this [[world]]. There are a few heros that are along the path of ascension.

**Divine Relations**

Common forms

The religious system is a polytheism. Individuals are not restricted to believing in or even worshipping a single deity. Churches often supported each other to the benefit of each other and their constituency. A chapel within a castle may be dedicated to multiple gods, or even the Kalevala Gods or the Gods of Despair (Pohjola). Several temples may be built in a single complex, allowing the clerics to provide a common defense/services and worshippers to efficiently give praise.

The deities and their Churches are organized into 3 groups. Kalevala is made up primarily of good aligned. The Churches of these deities engage to protect people and make their lives better.

The Gods of Despair is made up primarily of evil aligned. The Churches of these deities are focused on ‘no holds barred’ advocating for their parishioners. The Gods in Waiting tend to be Neutral with respect to the respect for life/dignity and willingness to kill with little qualms. They don’t oppose either the Kalevala Gods or the Gods of Despair, oftentimes maintaining a positive relationship with both groups. They are often viewed as waiting to see who prevails, but are much more likely to have other values that they consider more important to be distracted by the battle between good and evil.

Followers

Religious personnel

Most deity’s Churches have the following clergy. Archbishop, bishop, high priest, priest, and deacon. There is only one Archbishop. A high priest is responsible for a specific church or temple. Deacons are very limited in what rites they can perform.

Clerics are the mortal might of their deities. While they are not necessarily combat oriented, they receive special gifts that are intended to be used in the service of their deity. They are rarely located at one particular building for extended periods of time rather going were duty calls; and this is often in the midst of struggle and conflict. While they often experience authority with followers of their deity and with Templars, they often operate outside of the authority structure found within individual churches. In some cases, clergy may even xxx clerics out of jealousy or the amount of autonomy they have within the Church.

Temples and churches are protected by Templars. While Templars can be any class, they are often Honor Guard, Righteous [[Protectorate]], or Holy Warriors (note: none of these classes have been built in 5e, in fact they would probably be archetypes or sacred oaths). Honor guard are closely aligned with paladins. Holy warriors are closely aligned with fighters. Righteous protectorates are a special class that can advance as offensive or defensive capabilities as they gain levels.

Alignments: Honor Guard must be the alignment of the deity. Clerics and religious positions above priest are usually the same alignment. Righteous [[Protectorate]] must be the alignments that most closely align with their deity. Holy Warriors must be the non-neutral alignment of their deity.

**Dieties and their Churches**

Coari (some of this description comes from the Deities and Demigods 3rd edition)

Quasidiety

Symbol: Silhouette of a Woman or Sea Shell

Home Plane: Olympus

Alignment: CG

Sympathetic alignments: CG, CN, NG

Worshippers: Artists, lovers, bards, elves

Sphere of Control: Lust, Beauty

Domains (5e): Life

Color: Violet

Animal: Peacock

Favorite Weapon: Dagger

The deity of romantic love, sexual desire, and physical beauty, Coari embodies those ideals. She appears as a human woman of phenomenal beauty, dressed in a simple gown and adorned with jewelry. She is usually smiling and in fact is often called “smile-loving” or “laughter-loving Coari.” Both Wainen and Otter are courting Coari, and she is greatly pleased by their rivalry. Coari is an element of Aphrodite of the Greek pantheon.

Dogma: Coari embodies the joy of passion, freedom, and whimsy. Her brand of passion creates, and she celebrates the beauty of life in all forms. Laughter-loving Coari urges her followers to take whatever pleasure can be extracted from life without allowing social strictures to squelch their freedom, their creativity, or their passion. Though she promotes the ideals of good, she does not demand that anyone take up arms to promote it. Though her own actions have provoked great conflicts Aphrodite would prefer to see mortals make love rather than war.

Clergy, Templars, and Temples: Aphrodite’s clerics are matchmakers, dispensers of advice to the lovelorn, and general meddlers in other people’s personal business. They are also prominent hedonists, seeking out every opportunity to enjoy what pleasures this [[world]] offers before moving on to the next. Most are gentle and peaceable, and few find any reason to adventure. Those that do adventure generally do so out of a belief that their actions can improve the [[world]], making it a more peaceful place where love and beauty ca flourish in the absence of violence and evil.

Coari’s temples are beautifully decorated with fine art and precious implements. They are usually found only in cities, though Coari herself is revered more broadly. Her Templars are not typically aggressive, unless necessary, and prefer to persuade and charm interlopers. Coari’s temples are typically established in areas where they don’t need exceptional protection and her followers make sure to maintain positive relations with those who can provide aid if needed.

Sutamo

Quasidiety

Symbol: Glossy Orb in Blackness

Home Plane: Tarterus

Alignment: CN

Sympathetic alignments: CN, CE, tN

Worshippers: Thieves, thugs, and assassins

Sphere of Control: Darkness

Domains (5e): Trickery

Color: Jet Black

Animal: Bat

Favorite Weapon: Short Sword

Sutamo appears a man in leathers and shroud in shadow. He is a powerful warrior; strong, agile, and skillful. No darkness can obscure his view.

Dogma: Sutamo was a follower of Tuoni before his ascension. He is a powerful fighter, but emphasizes taking advantage of other skills as well. Sutamo does not believe that a fair fight is judged by equal Strength or awareness, rather he believes that a warrior should fight with all his available resources. Energy is spent on developing non-combat skills, so they should be available for a battle as well. Numerous rogues and thugs worship Sutamo, keeper of the night. Although Sutamo does not seek out such company, he does not discourage it either. Some assassins, primarily those that kill for reasons other than money, worship Sutamo as well.

Clergy, Templars, and Temples: Sutamo’s clerics and worshippers are not easy to recognize. They simply appear as hard-working citizens. Their few temples are often remote or well disguised. Most formal worship happens late at night, particularly during full moons.
