**Notes**
- In [[016-20200605]]:
    - After the defeat of the orcs, you don't notice anything initially until a few hours later you catch yourself humming. It is a tune that you have been unconsciously hearing ever since you sliced the orc. You're not sure there is anything significant about the ditty itself, but it comes from the recesses of your mind that are active when you 'meditate and do warlocky things.'
    - Over the next couple of days, Olseris seemed more chipper (or at least less withdrawn) than usual." The less somber, nearly cheerful, mood lasts 2-3 days
- in [[023-20200820]]:
    - Killed by [[Dark Might]] while trying to escape with [[Eljas]]
