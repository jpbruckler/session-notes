**Background**

Powerful Family Relationships:

- [[Fenneiros Serana]] (brother) - caused you to have a horrible accident when you were a child. They still feel incredible guilt, which they would do anything to assuage. 

Other Allies:

- This person was once a beggar to whom you gave a large sum of money. They have transformed their life thanks to you and now want to repay your generosity. You bonded with this person over a traumatic event such as a battle or an armed robbery. If you ever tell them that you are in danger they will try to aid you. This person owes you their life. Even if they can‚Äôt follow you everywhere you go they will do anything they can to protect you.

Originally from: https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Reitheillaethor Retreated into solitude after the village was attacked, but eventually left due to loneliness. Eventually ran into [[Tsakor]], and developed a strong trust in him.

Fateful Moment:

- You were caught in a terrible storm but miraculously survived. Now your dreams contain visions sent by a mysterious god or demigod. 

Mysterious Secret:

- I once saw a giant bird soar past overhead. It croaked out a cry that sounded like my name then disappeared beyond the clouds.
