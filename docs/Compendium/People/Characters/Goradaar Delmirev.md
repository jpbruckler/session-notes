**Background**

The town of [Winterhaven](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Winterhaven) was located on the East Way, between the nations of Sembia and Cormyr. It was situated on the road between Arabel and Highmoon. Due to its location in the middle of the Thunder Peaks, it was not uncommon for the inhabitants to be attacked by monstrous races such as kobolds and goblins.

An ancient dragon burial site laid southwest of the town, and the ruined Shadowfell Keep laid northeast

OTHER

- **Fateful moments**: A famous mage saw potential in you and tutored you in the arcane arts. You have a spellbook and the Magic Initiate feat from the Player’s Handbook. 
- **Fav food**: Hot beef soup with fresh bread 
- **Mysterious secret**: An old seer once touched my forehead and gave me a vision of a flaming bird chained beneath a mountain squirming and wailing in the darkness.
