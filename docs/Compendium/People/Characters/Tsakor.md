## Backstory

Tsakor is a halforc who has found his niche and ‘brotherhood’ as an enforcer/guard for [[The Darkhouse]]; a [[The Darkhouse|Church of Sutamo]], patron of thieves. His desire is to help people, not hurt people. Therefore, he tends to get defensive assignments like guard duty or acting as a body guard for a member of the clergy when in town. 

An enterprising half-elven priest befriended and recruited him to the cause. Although not highly intelligent, Tsakor has a knack for strategy as well as brute force. He can sometimes fall back to pure might and intimidation when frustrated, but he does not mindlessly charge his team into the fray. Tsakor's cover name is Drakur "the Maul" Rumblestrike. He rarely uses his cover name as Tsakor (the identity) is associated with his 'sell sword turned adventurer' persona. The Maul (the identity) is associated with this criminal persona. His residence and employment was at [[The Darkhouse]] before moving to [[Waterdeep]], with all the secrecy that entails. His 'cover story' when interacting with people outside the church is that he free lances providing personal security for hire. In addition to his unoccupied saferoom in the Shadowhouse in [[Waterdeep]], Tsakor stays in [[The Yawning Portal]] Inn located on Rainrun Street in [[Waterdeep]]. This is his launching point for adventures with his current companions, including [[Hani Wildheart]]. Tsakor has built an acquaintance with [[Balthorr Olaskos|Balthorr “the Bold” Olaskos]] of [[Balthorr’s Rare and Wondrous Treasures]].

Balthorr befriended Tsakor, granting him access to a contraband, fences, forgers, etc.                 

Rather than all three traveling back through the portal, [[Freedom Operative]] [[Morton]] took the trip to report in to [[Bishop Ramon]] with all three reports. Four months later he returned with their new orders. [[Father Anthis]] is to establish a new church. Tsakor is to continue adventuring to provide financial support for the fledgling [[The Darkhouse|Church of Sutamo]] extension. At least 15% of all his acquired treasure will be turned over to the Church to fund operations.
