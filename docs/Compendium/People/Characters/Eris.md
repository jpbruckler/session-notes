**Background**

As a child, I was cursed by a hag. My parents desperately wanted a child but were unable to conceive. They made a deal with a hag that lived in a swamp near my village - my mother would be found with child, and in return, they would owe the hag a favor. An obviously poor deal, but when desperate, any chance at happiness seems worth the cost. 

After I was born, my father spent his free time trying to find a way to break the pact with the hag. In the end, he was successful, though it cost him an eye in the exchange. The hag was furious and cursed me to die on my 23rd birthday. 

For my part, I dedicated my short life to learning as much about the world as I could. During my 8th summer, a traveling band of gnomish tinkers came through the village. I was enthralled with everything I could learn about their custom. I still remember how foreign and wonderful it seemed to me when I first saw them greet each other - the men would kiss the hand of the women, and their handshakes were always done with intense eye contact and grasping the forearm of the other man. 

In my 16th year, I set out from the village to learn all that I could about the world. I promised my parents I would return before my 23rd birthday, packed a bag, and set off. 

While travelling, I happened about a clan of Fey in a forest, or they happened upon me. I was lost and had run out of water. Dehydrated and emaciated, they nursed me back to health. I was with them for a year, and in that time did all that I could to learn their customs and be as useful to them as I could be. 

During that year, the medicine woman learned of my curse, and she worked with the elders of the community to create a ritual to try to rid me of my curse. While the ritual was ultimately successful, they misjudged the strength of the curse, and breaking it was not without repercussion. The medicine woman and I were both killed. 

As my soul was leaving my body the sorrow that I felt for the damage that I caused and that I'd denied my parents the ability to see me once more before I died caused my soul to linger. During this time an Archfey appeared to me. He made a deal with me - my life and a bit of his power in exchange for a favor. I took it. I guess I'm my father's daughter afterall. 

These days I make my own luck, and let fate take me where it will, doing my best to help those that can't help themselves.
