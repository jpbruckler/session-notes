# King Joren

## Notes

Joren was an adventurer during the [[Northern Invasion]]. As [[Julo Aimes]] brought half the civilized world together to keep the remnants of the army from destroying communities, Joren became the General of the [[Southern Army]] and developed the line of forts below the [[Great Forest]] separating [[Aimesland]] from the [[Ravaged Lands|Conquered Lands]] . As the line was settled, [[Aimesland]] was divided. Joren became the monarch of what came to be known as the [[Jorenian Kingdom]].
