 one of the Gods of Despair, is known as the god of death. [[Surma]] emphasizes combat prowess and the ability to destroy his opponents. Tests of combat do not have to be to the death, but the ability and willingness to take a life is paramount. Periodically, tournaments and tests of combat prowess are held in the open area. Priests often share public seminars describing important and historic deaths in the main room, for example those that freed the land from tyranny or the death of a bandit leader. Some innovative clergy organize reenactments of famous battles and deaths.
