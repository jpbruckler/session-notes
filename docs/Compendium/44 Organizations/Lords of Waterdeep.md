## Description

The **Lords of Waterdeep** were the mysterious and predominantly anonymous ruling council of [[Waterdeep]], having governed the city from the 11th century onwards. They oversaw the regional economy, maintained security, performed diplomacy, and held legal jurisdiction over the city and exert their will over the surrounding lands for approximately 100 mi (160 km) beyond its walls.

## Organization

A full council comprised 20 Lords, though this number might vary from 16 to 29. The full number of Lords was not always known and some Lords were kept secret.

Open Lord [Piergeiron](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Piergeiron_the_Paladinson "Piergeiron the Paladinson") and a Masked Lord in official garments _circa_ [1372 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1372_DR "1372 DR").

The Open Lord of Waterdeep (also called the "Unmasked Lord") was the sole member of the Lords of Waterdeep whose identity was publicly known. They held a number of additional titles including Warden of Waterdeep, Overmaster of the Guilds, and Commander of the Watch. The Open Lord was also the city's chief diplomat. There was only one Open Lord at any one time, but when the previous one died or stepped down, they were replaced by a new one.

There were seven Open Lords of Waterdeep to 1489 DR; 

1. Ahghairon the Mage
2. Baeron Silmaeril
3. Lhestyn the Masked Lady
4. Piergeiron the Paladinson
5. Caladorn Cassalanter
6. Dagult Neverember
7. Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]]

The Lords of Waterdeep were only seen in public when sitting in the Lord's Court or when appearing each year at Shieldmeet Council when the Lord's Rule is reaffirmed. The identities of the Lords, other than the Open Lord, were not supposed to be known to the public, although they were known to each other. The intent of this was to ensure that the Lords were free of coercion and could be drawn from any social strata within the city. While the masked Lords were considered to be equal to the Open Lord in authority, some executive authority was reserved for the Open Lord, including the vetting and selection of new Lords, the naming of the next Open Lord, and determining the needed number of Lords.
