## Description

The Hood is an organization of religious zealots whose ranks include deadly humanoids of all types. After petitioning the [[Aleanor]] for admittance, one may be permitted to join as a squire. They can progress to a [[Knight of the Shadow]], [[Knight of the Night]], and [[Knight of the Rose]]. These knights can be easily recognized by the medallion they wear (if you know what to look for) and oftentimes wear a dark green cloak with an appropriate clasp. They are very motivated by a queer sense of honor.
