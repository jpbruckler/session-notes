# Brotherhood ID Card

Tags: [[The Brotherhood|Brotherhod]], [[The Brotherhood]]

## Notes

The ID card has dull colors and an emblem in its center. The emblem is of a shield with grey hands holding it up. The shield depicts a clawed hand on its face. Below the emblem, a vertical bar lists three pairs of characters. For this card, the lowest pair is stamped. There is room at the top of the card for a name or other letters, but none appear there.
