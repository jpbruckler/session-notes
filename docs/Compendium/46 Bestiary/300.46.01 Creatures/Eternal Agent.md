The lesser incarnation is a bestial creature, fast and blood-thirsty. They run on all fours and can climb sheer surfaces faster than a gnome can run across an open field. Crimson skin and dark black hair adds to the evilness of their look. It is haunting. And they hunt in packs, like wolves. Dying to one of these monsters, you could lose your own soul. For there is some reference to the unfortunate soul raised as a mere shadow. 

The standard version looks a lot more like a human from the wild lands. It uses swords and sorcery rather than claws and bite. They are more cunning than the lesser version, but still simple. And they aren’t vulnerable to heavenly spells as the lesser version. 

The greater version is still a bit of a mystery. They are at least 3 dwarves in height and not very inventive. But also unflappable in their patience and pursuits, unusual for undead. But they can destroy life in a wink. Some find their abjuration spells difficult to overcome.
