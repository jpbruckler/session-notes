## Description

The store is located on the north side of [[Phandalin]], and to the west of owner [[Elmar Barthen]]'s home. It's the first shop would would see when entering [[Phandalin]] from the [[Triboar Trail]].

## History

In 1491 DR, [[Gundren Rockseeker]], a dwarf explorer, struck a deal to transfer a wagon full of goods from [[Neverwinter]] to Barthen's store. He hired a group of novice adventurers to transport the goods, however he himself was waylaid by goblin bandits and never made it to the trading post.

During this time, Barthen's Provisions also struck deals to sell dry goods and supplies to logging operations run by [[Tibor Wester]], the half-brother of Townmaster [[Harbin Wester]], as well as deals to sell herds of giant goats on behalf of [[Dagult Neverember]] in order to fund rebuilding efforts in Leilon.

Sometime in late 1495 DR or early 1496 DR, the company went out of business. The building was then purchased by an unknown person who donated it to the worship of [[Waukeen]], and it was quickly renovated into the [[Temple of the Coinmaiden]].
