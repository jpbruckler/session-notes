# Northern Frontier

Campaign:: [[30-39 TTRPG/32 Campaigns/32.02 SumonHo/32.02 SumonHo|34.01 SumonHo]]
Setting:: [[Scalinea]]

## Description

The Northern Frontier is an extensive land of deep forests and mighty monsters. It is also the dominion and providence of the [[Eternal One]], a powerful undying evil in the service of [[Yethmonien]] (sometimes described as the godling of murder and sometimes as a powerful ultroloth).

Before he was killed by a party from [[Dragons Coffin]], including [[Joren]], [[Drawr]], [[Ajax]], Cody, [[Ryan|Sir Ryan]], and [[Travis]], [[Oigah]]â€™s fortress was in this region. He was an ogre hero (villian) in allegiance with the [[Eternal One]]. He led the [[Northern Army]] into the Southern Lands. His army primarily consisted of ogres, orcs, goblins, trolls, and at least one [[stone giant]].
