## Description
Locacted a day travel south of [[Thornburg]] then due west 6 hours into the [[Ravaged Lands]], the Chillin’ Tower was once the home of a [[necromancer]] named [[Frukar Excelar]]. [[Frukar Excelar|Frukar]] and his henchmen, both living and undead, fell to [[Danger Inc.]] on day 24 of the 6th month in the year 31 AR.

The Chillin’ Tower is 40 feet off the trail. The area is heavily wooded, although the area between the tower and the trail is clear. At the time of the necromancer’s death, much of the vegetation was suffering from blight and no animals came within a mile of the tower. Even most insects avoided the area, flies and certain beetles being the exception.

The southern door on the second floor is one-way, allowing access into the guardroom. The door at the top of the stairs between the second and third floors is also a one-way door into the guard room. The doors can be propped open by a toe-activated lever that is not conspicuous.

Three steps lead up to the platform in front of the iron-bound wooden door. The roof has trapdoor access and a short wall but is otherwise featureless. The trap door cannot be opened from the outside.
