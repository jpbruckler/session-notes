# Confederation of Independent City-States

Campaign:: [[30-39 TTRPG/32 Campaigns/32.02 SumonHo/32.02 SumonHo|34.01 SumonHo]]
Setting:: [[Scalinea]]

## Description

The Confederation of Independent City-states is typically known as The Confederation or CIC. The Confederation is fraught with intrigue and politics. The populace generally feels they can make it if they try hard enough, but there are clearly the 'haves and the have-nots,' the privileged work hard to maintain privileges. Due to the recognition of the large cities within the territory as independent, much of the law enforcement and military might that people encounter are local to the city or lordship. Therefore, within the cities a character is most likely to encounter local forces. Tresville has The Confederation government buildings and therefore has more presence, but all of the cities have some CIC forces. Characters are most likely to encounter CIC forces traveling between cities or entering/leaving The Confederation territory. The lightly populated areas between city-states are not heavily patrolled but have sufficient force to be relatively safe when traveling in large numbers.

**Police-** The [[Confederation Police]] is the force that augments local law enforcement and independently investigates crimes of interest to The Confederation government. They are recognizable by a light green sash around their waist with an emblem of three wolves with the front one howling. The [[Confederation Police]] are not normally heavy-handed, but can be overbearing when necessary to execute their duties. Local law enforcement isn't obligated to defer to The [[Confederation Police]], but if they are seen inhibiting CIC interests it is well-known that The Confederation has many ways to apply pressure for those actively interfering with its interests.

**[[Protectorate]]-** The Confederation [[Protectorate]] is the standing army. They are recognizable by a dark green sash around their waist with an emblem of an eagle with outstretched wings. [[Protectorate]] are soldiers who prefer tactics that exploit vulnerabilities that they find in their opponents. They have a higher number of scouts and lightly armored soldiers than the monarch armies.

**[[Varjo]]-** The Confederation [[Varjo]] are a specialized force who provides intelligence and investigates some significant events. The [[Varjo]] are considered 'secret police.' They are masters of disquise, intelligence collection, and reconnaissance. They provide the CIC governing body with the information that they need to make appropriate decisions even if information is withheld from them by others. Occassionally, their role is often seen more as a way to keep the current government in power. They possess a dull grey tunic with the emblem of a raven for when they are acting overtly and desire to be recognized. They carry a badge that identifies them in case they need to prove their station.
