## Description

For the last several centuries before the [[Northern Invasion]], the civilized worlds of the south have been separated from the monsters and wilds of the north by the Great Divide. Often referred to as the Barrier Mountains following the ravaging of the [[Ravaged Lands|Conquered Lands]], the Great Divide still holds back much of the fearful creatures of the north. There are a few paths that traverse the nearly impassable mountain range. One such trail is the [[Phelandor Pass]] utilized by the [[Northern Army]].
