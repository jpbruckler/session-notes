### History

For 17 generations the barony has passed to the eldest Aldwulf child in an unbroken line, until the 15th day of The Fading in 1492 DR when [[John Brunis]], Count of Eor, awarded the barony to [[The Legion of the Emerald Goat]].

During the [[Siege on Sakatha’s Stronghold ]] (1087 DR), [[Thorley Aldwulf]]  distinguished himself among the rest of the fighting force by finding and exploiting a weakness in the wall around [[Sakatha]]’s fortress in [[The Evermoors]]. Thorley led a small contingent of men on a scouting mission to try to find where [[Sakatha]]’s forces were bringing supplies in. During this scouting mission a partially submerged tunnel was spotted. Thorley and these men cleared the tunnel entrance, and were able to gain entrance to [[Sakatha]]’s stronghold. Thorley and his men opened up a gate, allowing the larger force led by [[Sigeweard Brunis]] to enter the compound. This single act directly led to the destruction of [[Sakatha]]. After [[Sakatha]] fell, Sigeweard was made a count. His first action as count was to make Thorley a baron in recognition of his contribution to freeing the land from the Lizard King’s evil grip.
