## Description

As you top the hill under you, in the distance you can see what many of you know to be the Dancing Drake Inn. The campus is surrounded by a wall three and a half foot tall. On the side facing the [[Ravaged Lands]], a 9’ wall has been erected on the outside edge of the shorter wall. The road turns south at the Inn although it enters the campus from both the south and the west. A smaller road also exits the campus heading due north. Nestled among tall grass and fields of hay, the campus seems peaceful except for the wall and the three story tower with parapets. A stable and some smaller buildings also occupy the campus.

A buff man in his 40s named [[Orkin]] takes your three horses to be stabled in the barn. As you approach the Inn proper, a young woman draws a bucket out of the well underneath the overhang of the second floor. Three steps lead up to a set of double doors. Stepping inside, a door marked in common, elven, and orcish as “Employee Only” is directly in front of you. A 5’ wide hallway runs north and south. You can hear the noise of a busy tavern to your right.

At the end of the hall, you are able to enter the main dining room. Among the regulars sitting at tables and the bar, three well-traveled individuals sit around a far table. An elf in a heavy cloak that obscures most detail beyond that of a longbow watches as a female in splint armor with shield seems to be giving instructions to a young, attentive man in a chain shirt.

[[Bronson]] leans over a chair at the bar, “Barkeep.” “Hello. Names [[Tucker]]. How can I best serve you this day?” [[Bronson]] says, “I’m here to see a man named [[Averos]]. Can you point me in his direction?” [[Tucker]] responds, “Certainly. He has reserved the Gathering Room. If you head out the front door there”, he points across the room, “he will be in the small building across the way.”

As you step out the main entrance, you are shaded by the overhang of the second floor. This feature would allow you to eat outside, fetch water, or just relax outdoors even in the rain. As you step into the sunlight, an employee who appears to be negotiating with a local farmer on the price of a steer smiles briefly at you. You walk to a small building and enter without knocking. The building has a small ‘breakout room’ or foyer. The inviting smell of vanilla tantalizes you as a tray of cookies sits on a table. You continue, passing into the main meeting room. As you enter this spacious room able to seat 15 people comfortably, a half-elf and human male sit at the large table as a dwarf in leather armor halts his telling of a grand tale. It seems you have interrupted at the crescendo.
