## Description

This is a comfortable tavern for the merchant class and visiting elite. It has four spacious rooms available for the distinguished traveler. There are 2 meeting rooms on the premises as well. [[Felosial]], a female elf commoner, attends to the daily management of the business and staff. The establishment is owned by [[Victor]], a male human noble.

[[Alex]] stated that there were 3 murders in [[Fowlerville]] in the last week; 2 goblin attacks and a witness who thought they saw a strangulation at the upscale Crouching Dragon Tavern and Inn. While the suspicion wasn't enough for the [[Peacekeepers]] to infringe on the town's closed investigation, their assistance in the defense of the town made the Constable, [[Krisvyre]], willing to let them do a follow-up investigation.

- [[001-20200130]] - [[Eljas]] went to talk to the manager of the Crouching Dragon Tavern, [[Felosial]]. While she didn't like him in the building, he talked her into telling him about the man. He appeared to be a wealthy merchant. He was tall with a bushy beard and a lot of hair. After staying that night, he slipped out and she didn't see him again. [[Eljas]] purposely then left a dusty mess on the way out the door.
