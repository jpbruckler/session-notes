Small, hill-side mining village of Fowlerville is a largely human settlement with over 1,500 residents (including outlying farms).

Significant locations in Fowlerville are…

**Village Hall**- The mayor of Fowlerville is Theodor Jaquez, a male human noble (LG). Mayor Jaquez is a portly man with dark hair in fine but somewhat disheveled clothing.

**Jail**-Krisvyre, a female half-elf veteran (NG), is the constable. [[Krisvyre]] is the primary law enforcer for Fowlerville and its outlying farms, receiving support from the Fowlerville-stationed [[Peacekeepers]] when needed or when a violation of [[Aimesland]] law requires their attention. [[Krisvyre]] appears as middle-aged, is engaging, and prepared to act to protect the community whenever needed.  

**[[Aimesland]] office**- Roger, a male human Fighter (6th, LN), is the Siena Officer in Charge at this post. [[Alex]], a human male Fighter (5th, LN), is the senior Peacekeeper. 

**Garrison**- The [[Aimesland]] Garrison is a large block 2-story building with bars on the windows. A training field rests behind the building. There is usually one or two guards on duty. Inside, there is an office (not open to the public), a kitchen, a mess hall, a small dining room, 2 storage rooms, 3 individual rooms, a large partitioned troop room, and a training room. Currently the individual rooms are occupied by Lieutenant Roger, Sergeant Dakath, and Soldier Elizabeth. 

**The Welcome Spot** **(General Store)**- Vivien Powell (Hucrele in _the Sunless Citadel_), a female human noble (NG), owns and operates the general store. Vivien is a well-dressed middle aged matriarch with long brown hair normally worn up in a bun. Her wisdom and shrewdness makes her a well-respected member of Fowlerville.

**Fowlerville Anvil (Blacksmith)**- The storefront of this store is adorned with metal items, including horseshoes, daggers, and cups. Inside the shop of “The Anvil,” all manner of smithed metal goods can be found; from weapons and armor to gates to agricultural implements to cooking wares to religious items. Rurik Lutgehr, male dwarf commoner (LE), works both the shop and the forges. He is of moderate skill with the iron, but has an employee of significant skill. Rurik has a passion for the implements of war and enjoys talking about many topics with people who visit his store. Although not too open about it, Rurik believes in swift and decisive punishment. 

**Nimble Thimble (Tailor)**- This small store in the center of a 3-shop wooden building has material in rolls and finished products draped over hangers, tables, and bars throughout the interior. A few pieces of finished clothing hangs outside the shop as well. The talented husband and wife team of Marcus and Eleanor Wallace, both human commoners, own and operate this shop. One of the Wallaces are here at all times that the shop is open, although in truly rare occasions they have a couple of adult children who can watch the shop in their stead. The low ceilinged upper floor is where the couple live. They are well dressed with clothing of their own design, but beyond are shy and somewhat reclusive.

**[[Rested Moose Inn]] (Inn & Tavern)**- This well-worn building offers a meal and room for a reasonable rate. In addition to the 9 sparse rooms and 1 larger one, a common sleeping area can be rented for a cheap rate. Arnold, a male human commoner (CN), is the owner and barkeep. Melony, a female human commoner (tN), serves food and drink to the tables.

**Fleet Foot Stable (Stables)-** Allison, a female human Bard (2nd, CG), owns the stables where horses can be bought or penned. In a small room, she also sells herbs, spices, and medicines. She also is on retainer with the [[Seina]] soldiers as a healer.  Due to her passion for healing and helping others, the actual running of the stables is usually left to [[Grux]], a male half-orc [[Ranger]] (5th, NG, favored enemy Orc, Goblinoid).     

**The [[Crouching Dragon Tavern]] and Inn (Inn & Tavern)**- This is a comfortable tavern for the merchant class and visiting elite. It has four spacious rooms available for the distinguished traveler. There are 2 meeting rooms on the premises as well. [[Felosial]], a female elf commoner, attends to the daily management of the business and staff. The establishment is owned by [[Victor]], a male human noble.

**Buckets to Wagons or B2W (Industrial Store)**- This store has everything you would need to mine or farm. It specializes in commercial endeavors and has a robust order catalog. The proprietor is Arnold Ellison, a male human commoner.

**Mining Guild**- The mining guild is an organization dedicated to mining in Fowlerville. The chairman is Andrew, a male human noble, a tall slender man in fine clothing. Andrew’s assistant [[Tonya]], a human female commoner, can often be found at the guild when he isn’t. The day-to-day activity of the guild office is managed by Ruffik, a male dwarf commoner. Each mine is operated by an independent general manager but coordination at the guild helps make operations more efficient (i.e. addressing labor shortages or not scheduling outages at the same time). The guild offers membership to owners, managers, and even individual miners. It advocates for the mining industry and even offers training in mining roles to townspeople when needed.

**Laborers Guild**- The laborers guild is an organization providing services for laborers. Whether unskilled laborers or semi-skilled workers (i.e. teamsters, agriculture workers, miners, shepherds, etc.), employers and workers can connect with each other in front of this 4-shop wooden building.   

**[[Clinic of Healing]] (Clinic/medic)**- The clinic can be found beside the guilds in Fowlerville. The exterior is clean and the well-lit interior is spacious and open. Three cots with privacy screens await the next patients. Doctor Samual Elderburg, a male human commoner, is the traveling surgeon that practices in this room. Dr. Sam is typically in Fowlerville once a week, but is here a minimum of twice a month. Assisting Dr. Sam and servicing the clinic in his absence is [[Lesdyl]], a dwarf female commoner. The mining guild provided a person to run the clinic. [[Lesdyl]] is there to serve her customers the best she can but she also has loyalty to the guild.

**Griffin Delivery (Warehouse/Shipper)**- This office building and large warehouse is surrounded by an 8 foot wall with a 6 foot fence atop it. Griffin Delivery is owned by two partners; Melinda, a female human *commoner or noble*, and Ipaston, a gnome male *artisan*. Melinda is an outgoing, energetic, and charismatic salesperson who dresses in well-fitting dresses of bright colors and patterns. Ipaston is a diligent, focused, hardworking administrator, although occasionally his trickster gnomish tendencies get the most of him. His slacks and shirt are often wrinkled, but from long wear rather than unkemptness.   

**Shrine (Mielikki)**- One of two public shrines in Fowlerville, this shrine is dedicated to Mielikki, the Supreme Huntress and Mistress of Nature. In particular, scouts, soldiers going on patrol, rangers, and farmers worship at this shrine. It is maintained by Mialee, a female human priest of Mielikki (Cleric 2nd, NG), who cares for the shrine and its parishioners.  Mialee is helpful and a bit playful, but she takes the business of caring for her charges serious. Just like her diety, Mialee is a skillful healer. She is assisted by [[Alledon]], a male elven ranger (6th, NG).

**Shrine (Rauna)-** The other public shrine in Fowlerville is dedicated to Rauni, goddess of earth and creation. In particular, Fowlerville miners worship at this shrine. It is maintained by Rosilys “Rosey” Jelgyra, a female gnome priest of Rauni (Cleric 1st, LN). Rosey is an industrious and resourceful character of serious disposition.

**Village Heights (block housing)**-  Many of the residences of Fowlerville live in ‘block housing; small housing units built in several straight rows with small streets between them. It is a humble but relatively comfortable living space. 

**Main Market**- The main market has many wares including fresh food. Many of the residences spend their day working or shopping in the market. The people of Fowlerville are cheerful but not trusting of strangers.

**[[Riverside Mine]] (primarily copper)**- [[Argon]], a male human noble (LE) is the operator and general manager of the [[Riverside Mine]]. [[Argon]] is a straight forward man who idealizes efficiency and order. He has been known to use thugs in the tent camp to keep “order.” He also charges merchants a ‘fee/commission’ to sell their wares close to prime real estate. [[Argon]] has 2 assistant managers. [[Anton]], a male human [[rogue]] (LE), is a shrewd manager although with a callous streak. Heijin, a female dwarf commoner, provides much of the expertise to the mining operation. She is blunt but fair in her dealings with the miners.

**Bhalrak Mine (primarily iron ore)**- Baern, a male dwarf commoner (LN), is the operator and general manager of the Bhalrak Mine. Baern, is a very hands-on manager in the mine, leaving little time for other pursuits. He is largely disinterested in the tent camp so long as it doesn’t interfere with his operations. He has an assistant manager name Gardic, a male dwarf veteran. Gardic was a veteran of the [[Northern Invasion]] before becoming a full time miner. He is now advanced in age but still a stout and capable miner.

**Miner’s camp**- There is a miner’s camp at the head of both mine shafts. It has a semi-permanent tent city, a few cooking tents, and a market.
