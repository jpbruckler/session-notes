According to [[Olgann]]:
 - They are [[Penetration Stone|Power Stones]]. He would have called it a crimson [[Penetration Stone|Power Stone]], not a [[Penetration Stone|Penetration Stone]]. He didn't know that name.
 - There are different [[Penetration Stone|Power Stones]]. The ones mined from the lower [[planes]] were crimson and fused with necrotic/negative energy. [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] and [[Elinor]] noted he started to get cautious as they asked about his other [[Penetration Stone|Power Stones]].
 -  When "we got our stones" [[Glorgona]] was trying to perform a ritual that would take one of the dwarven cities to Hell. She was assisted by a [[Knight of the Night]] tiefling named [[Majesty]] and a group of [[Deadstone Giants]]
 - [[Glorgona]]'s ritual required at least 4 stones, but she was working on getting a fifth when [[Jasper Martin|Jasper]] and crew stopped her.

There are other Power Stones - Saphire & Emerald

1 went to [[Jasper Martin|Jasper]]
1 went to the Underdark Estate - [[Dreedasesh estate]]
1 went to [[Augustus Volgo]]
1 went to the Dwarf's (vault in the watchtower) - [[Nabrim the Terrific]]

    Dear [[Disciple Antwon]],
    
    I greatly appreciate your successful evocation of the 1st [[Binding Site]]. This accomplishment gives us a great start to piercing the veil between our world and the restless place of the forsaken souls of the people. It is the will of the 3 true gods to return these souls to their eternal right to inhabit this land. You have clearly set yourself apart as one of the bravest and most creative of our Brotherhood. You have clearly demonstrated your ingenuity and I am forever grateful.
    
    After establishing the 2nd [[Binding Site]], you shall meet with the acquisition team in [[Aimesville]] at the normal place. They are to acquire a Penetration Stone from the cellar of the [[Everson Estate]] locally. The owner is not expected to be cooperative. When they have it, they should deliver it to [[Disciple Kenton]].
    
    There are also 2 Penetration Stones to be acquired in the [[Ravaged Lands]]. They are in the possession of the shaman of the Tear Bringer orc tribe and the master of the [[Passion Place]]. Delivery instructions for these stones will be given to the team upon delivery of the [[Aimesville]] stone.
    
    There are three other Penetration Stones they should prepare to conquest. They are near the Demon’s Door so they will be extremely dangerous missions. But make them aware that this will be their responsibility when the time comes.
    
    I personally thank you for your service. It will be an amazing accomplishment to have 2 binding sites established. A third may allow some benefit if it can be created with the power of at least 30 souls. And you’re contribution has been of great worth. I’m sure The Three will reward you beyond what even I can offer.
    
    Eternally,
    The Prophet
