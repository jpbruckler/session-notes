!!! info
    Dear [[Disciple Antwon]],
    
    I greatly appreciate your successful evocation of the 1st [[Binding Site]]. This accomplishment gives us a great start to piercing the veil between our world and the restless place of the forsaken souls of the people. It is the will of the 3 true gods to return these souls to their eternal right to inhabit this land. You have clearly set yourself apart as one of the bravest and most creative of our Brotherhood. You have clearly demonstrated your ingenuity and I am forever grateful.
    
    After establishing the 2nd [[Binding Site]], you shall meet with the acquisition team in [[Aimesville]] at the normal place. They are to acquire a [[Penetration Stone|Penetration Stone]] from the cellar of the [[Everson Estate]] locally. The owner is not expected to be cooperative. When they have it, they should deliver it to [[Disciple Kenton]].
    
    There are also 2 [[Penetration Stone]] to be acquired in the [[Ravaged Lands]]. They are in the possession of the shaman of the Tear Bringer orc tribe and the master of the [[Passion Place]]. Delivery instructions for these stones will be given to the team upon delivery of the [[Aimesville]] stone.
    
    There are three other [[Penetration Stone]] they should prepare to conquest. They are near the [[Demons Door|Demon's Door]] so they will be extremely dangerous missions. But make them aware that this will be their responsibility when the time comes.
    
    I personally thank you for your service. It will be an amazing accomplishment to have 2 binding sites established. A third may allow some benefit if it can be created with the power of at least 30 souls. And you’re contribution has been of great worth. I’m sure The Three will reward you beyond what even I can offer.
    
    Eternally,
    <cite>[[The Prophet]]</cite>
