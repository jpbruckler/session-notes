> [Danger Inc.](app://obsidian.md/Danger%20Inc.) escorted [Calcryx](app://obsidian.md/Calcryx) back to the [Kobold Body](app://obsidian.md/Kobold%20Body), where the [White Dragon Wyrmling](app://obsidian.md/White%20Dragon%20Wyrmling) immediately went on the offensive. [Danger Inc.](app://obsidian.md/Danger%20Inc.) helped the kobolds re-capture the dragon and were rewarded with a key for their troubles. [Queen Yusdrayl](app://obsidian.md/Yusdrayl), convinced that the party would at least share the common goal of ridding the ruins of goblins, she was content to provide them passage throughout her domain.

## Session Log


Quest: [[Search and Rescue - Powell]]

- [[Yusdrayl]], in draconic, welcomed [[Calcryx]], the [[white dragon wyrmling]], home.
- [[Calcryx]] drew first blood, icing four kobolds. Not yet realizing the party’s treachery, he was careful not to hit [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]. He told [[Yusdrayl]] that he is “no one’s pet.”
- During the battle, [[Olseris]] detected a [[goblin]] raider. It turned out there were 4 present. An arrow was fired at an elite [[Monsters K#^47a2a2|Kobold]] and a magical electric arrow hit [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] critically hard.
- One raider was killed by a [[kobold]]. The one with the magical shortbow was killed by [[Bronson]] as it tried to escape.
- With a couple of blows landed, [[Elinor]] tried to use her sleep spell to incapacitate him. It dropped three kobolds and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], but didn’t have enough power left to stop [[Calcryx]].
- Between [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]’s sword, [[Olseris]]’s eldritch blast, and [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]’s longbow, [[Calcryx]] was brought down, the final blow being an arrow through the neck.
- [[Eljas]] used [[Spells S#Spare the Dying]] to save the dragon pet. 
- [[Yusdrayl|Yusdrayl]] turned the key over to him for the group’s service to the "[[Kobold Body]]" She also asked if they would continue to assist the "[[Kobold Body]]" by eliminating the goblins from the rest of the fortress, since it was clear they shared a dislike for them. She could not allow them to continue to get so bold. The party agreed. (About 2 dozen of them)
- The party took a long rest, discussing treasure distribution and which way to go next. The party would work to destroy the [[goblin]] warriors before tackling the magical areas (closet or lock). [[Bronson]] would carry the magic shortbow as no one else really needed one.
- The party stopped by [[Yusdrayl]] and awoke her to make sure they understood the deal. She told them there were about 2 dozen [[goblin]] warriors, not counting women and children.
- They traveled to the hazy room with dragon-carved columns.
- Taking the ‘dinosaur hallway’ around they found the [[Goblin]] lair housing families. They backed out without raising an alarm.
- They continued on to the door of a cylindrical wall.
