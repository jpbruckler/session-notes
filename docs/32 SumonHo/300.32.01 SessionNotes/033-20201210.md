#### Last Session Recap

![[032-20201119#^summary]]

## Session Log


- The party entered [[Aimesville]] at the fort closest to the [[Dancing Drake]] Inn.
- The party members were mostly honest in their registration. The story that they didn’t register because they missed the line was hard to believe but told convincingly. The soldier was required to get a superior in this case. With the soldier’s belief of their story (at [[Elinor]]’s telling), “[[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]]’s” offer/ability to help heal, and even [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]’s repair of the roof, the Captain passed them through with little wait.
- [[Danger Inc.]]  traveled to the [[Dancing Drake]] Inn.
- [[Auntie Caustic]] bypassed the fort and camped outside the [[Dancing Drake]] Inn’s short wall.
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]] got a haircut.  
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] grabbed the biggest room so the party could talk.
- [[Gwyn Hovey]] revealed his real name and that he had been misleading in order to determine the party’s true intentions with respect to the growing evil in the land.
- The party decided to head to [[Aimesville]] in the morning and seek training.
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] had another damaging sleep which reduced her maximum hp by 7 points.
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] verified with Primeval Awareness that fey and fiend creatures were within a mile.
- The party purchased a pair of horses to pull a new wagon, considering options to make the three+ day trip into as short of time as possible.
- The group collected [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]] ([[Auntie Caustic]]) and headed east for [[Aimesville]]. Hearing of [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]’s continued plight, [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]] let her borrow her circlet but 1) confirmed they had a mutual enemy in the devilish Master at [[Passion Place|Lower Ecstasy]] and 2) insisted it must be returned before they separate.
- The next night, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] didn’t necessarily sleep well but she did not suffer damaging nightmares.
- After they had traveled a bit the next morning, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] verified with Primeval Awareness that a was still nearby; that it was following them. [[Gwyn Hovey]] used Detect Good/Evil and determined [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]] was the fiend. He shared this information with the party.
- [[Elinor]] made [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]], [[Gwyn Hovey]], and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] be honest with Zone of Truth. She confirmed that [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]] was a fiend (blame her parents), did really know where [[Passion Place|Lower Ecstasy]] is located, did oppose the Master there, and believed as long as [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] wore her circlet that [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] wouldn’t be harmed again. Irritating so, [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]] said her presence caused [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]’s nightmare pains but she wouldn’t confirm that she actively or purposely did it. Most believed this omission, paired with her failure to state she was not the cause, simply meant it was her and she refused to admit it. [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]] seemed to continue to try to keep the common ground since they have a shared enemy in the Master who possesses the next [[Penetration Stone|Penetration Stone]].
- A few hours from [[Aimesville]] the party was stopped by [[Seina]] soldiers. They had reports of a crew of half a dozen people, including a tiefling and half-orc, robbing communities west of [[Aimesville]]. After determining they didn’t have any of the missing items the officer apologized for the inconvenience and let them be on their way.    
- The party, with [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]], continued on to [[Aimesville]]. [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]] would not enter [[Aimesville]], but the party knows where to find her. Thus far [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] hasn’t had any more painful nightmares but also hasn’t recovered her max-hp reduction.
- Once in [[Aimesville]], [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] looked up [[Laidor]] to ask about [[Auntie Caustic]] and [[Gwyn Hovey]]. [[Laidor]] didn’t know anything like [[Auntie Caustic]], but wouldn’t trust a fiend if she can help it. He would let her know if he heard anything. As far as [[Gwyn Hovey]], [[Laidor]] said he knew [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]] by reputation and he is “one of the good guys.”
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] sought out her brother Lem (aka [[Booster]]). He identified the circlet as non-magical. It was a simple brass ornamental device. [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] only shared this fact with [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]].
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] sold the helmet she found in the Glitterheim under the [[Stone Tooth]]. It was sold for 45 gp.
- The party members spend the next 3 weeks training to get the full benefits of 5th level.    
- Afterwards, [[Danger Inc.]]  intends to go after [[Yusdrayl|Yusdrayl]] to address the threat [[Dark Might]] poses to [[Bronson]].

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 8 am on Month 5/Day 23
