#### Last Session Recap

![[042-20220524#^summary]]

## Session Log



- Leaving the wasp nest, late the next day [[Elinor]] heard from [[Averos]]. He said, "[[Elinor]], wishing you all well. Are you searching for the '[[Eternal Artifacts]]?' Need a partner or should I reach out in 4 months?"
- [[Elinor]] said they were looking for the [[artifacts]], to establish the party wouldn't be looking for them 'for [[SLD]]' if they partnered on the effort.
- [[Elinor]] asked if he might be at the [[Dancing Drake]] Inn, as that is where she was headed. He said that he was only a day south of the inn, but he couldn't go up there for a week. They were welcome to join him if they were able and wanted to talk. He was at [[Roger's Farm|Rogers Farm]].
- They cut the corner and headed straight toward the road about a day south of the inn. Checking in a nearby town, they learned [[Roger's Farm|Rogers Farm]] was owned by Will Rogers, a description of it, and that it was a mile north of the town.
- [[Roger's Farm|Rogers Farm]]: It is a farm house with 2 barns, one particularly large and one relatively small. The stalls in the smaller barn hold 6 draft horses and 2 riding horses. [[SLD]] has a 10x20' room in the hay loft of the smaller barn. It has shelves of books, manuals, and papers behind a work desk. A table seats 8 people. The other barn houses cows and lamas. In a meadow is a small flock of sheep and a donkey; with a small three-walled shelter.
- Upon arriving, [[Danger Inc.]]  went straight to the smaller barn. [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] knocked, waiting half a minute, then opened the door. [[Erika]], a member of the security detail normally assigned to [[Averos]], was approaching the door.
- [[Erika]] showed them to the room upstairs. [[Averos]] welcomed them. Below was part of the interaction.
- In conversation, he mentioned he was bored but didn't state his business here.
- [[Averos]] confirmed they were aware of the rough location of 3 of the 4 [[Eternal Artifacts]].
  - The mace "is" north of central [[Aimesland]] in the mountains.
  - The robe is in a location that cannot be traveled to by land. Magic would allow them to get close enough that he could direct them where they had to go (but not "in which room").
  - Another item was near the [[Demons Door|Demon's Door]], which is due west from their current location.
  - There is a fourth item of unknown location.
- [[Averos]] finally understood that they were generally looking for the artifacts, but not searching for a specific one.
- [[Danger Inc.]]  gave him information about the cult. The intention was to gain favor by providing valuable information. They hoped to learn about what they faced in the [[Passion Place]] in return.
  - They don't know the cults name. The party didn't say anything about locations, neither [[Aimesville]] nor the [[Dirty Kitten]].
  - A ritual allows them to use the [[Penetration Stone]] to turn people into "zombies." Afterward, the stone cannot be moved. They said they don't know anything about the ritual itself.
  - They have recovered 2 stones ([[Averos]] thinks the party carries both).
  - [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] took it out of his pack with his bare hands to show [[Averos]]. [[Averos]] asked if he could touch it too. With permission he felt it, including the temperature and the smoothness.
  - Only briefly, but [[Averos]] read part of the letter referencing the locations of the [[Penetration Stone]].
  - [[Averos]] was permitted to pen a copy of [[Disciple Yarman]]'s letter. He was allowed to keep a copy of the membership card. He was not told what the block at the top was for (it was for a name).
  - [[Averos]] was showed [[Disciple Yarman]]'s letter and the membership card.
  - [[Averos]] said he was not familiar with the symbol on the membership card. [[Averos]] was also asked if the pairs of characters meant anything to him. (The conversation went on before he answered. Since I'm not sure if it was an in-game or out-of-game distraction, I'll tell you what he would have answered.) He said that he didn't know what they said, but he thought it was #ttrpg/language/Abyssal. He can speak/read several languages, 7 in fact, but #ttrpg/language/Abyssal isn't one of them.
  - In talking about the cult, [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] said to [[Elinor]] "Don't you have a letter?" Thinking of different letters, [[Elinor]] handed [[Averos]] the letter about the [[Penetration Stone]] instead of [[Disciple Yarman]]'s letter. [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], not wanting to share that information, agitatedly stormed up to the desk and snatched the letter out of his hands. [[Erika]] tensed at the aggressive and disrespectful act.
  - [[Elinor]] deftly switched out the original membership card for the forged one. She was certain [[Averos]] was sufficiently distracted. She wasn't sure if [[Erika]] saw, but [[Elinor]] had made an excellent performance.
- They headed out; heading south. After a couple hours on the road, they encountered a [[Displacer Beast]]. It turned out to be an ambush by dark clad humans; 4 men and a woman. One of the men was a spellcaster and the rest were warriors.
- Early in the fight, all of the party members felt a chill go down their spine and thought they heard the sound of a stone lid being pushed off of a sarcophagus.
- The spellcaster yelled that [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] had "it." The party is uncertain if "it" is [[Soulstriker|Soul Striker]] or the [[Penetration Stone]].  

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 5 pm on Month 6/Day 4

Note: It seems I have been using the name Devil's Gate instead of [[Demons Door|Demon's Door]] on a few occasions. If any NPC has ever used the term Devil's Gate, as [[Averos]] did in the last session, please realize I meant to say [[Demons Door|Demon's Door]]. This is the name in the letter talking about the [[Penetration Stone]] location.

Whoever attacked us seemed to be after [[Soulstriker|Soul Striker]].
