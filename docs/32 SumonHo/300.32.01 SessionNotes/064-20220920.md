#### Last Session Recap

![[063-20220905#^summary]]

## Session Log



natural chamber with a 50’ wide gap, with pillars from one side to the other, about 5’ apart. In order to cross, we decide to fly across, negating any athletic checks.

When we get across, it’s really pretty (I was taking Samson out).

Entering a huge natural chamber, made up of several other large chambers. Flourescent vegetation, weeds standing 6-7’ tall. Pale trees with olive leaves dot the landscape.

Kazoku Forest ^

[[Dranaste]] mentions we should stay on the rock, “The forest isn’t to be trusted.”

An hour or so we find a small outcropping/alcove that looks like it was the nest of some creature before.

[[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] cast’s Leomund’s Tiny Hut.

We discussed potential options for gaining[[Penetration Stone|[[Penetration ]]Stone| access to the]] stone of power.

1. Draw him out via a letter or some note
2. Sneak in and if it doesn’t work out, we fight our way out
3. Men-folk become slaves, women-folk appeal to the matriarch

In the morning we break camp and make our way to the left, away from a Drow outpost attached to a cavern ceiling to the right.

After about an hour, we smell a foul stench and hear whispering/hissing voices. Reptillian humanoids (troglodytes) are in conflict below us. They have a captive. They’re arguing about a sword. We wait for them to resolve their situation.

We sneak past the troglodytes after they murder each other, then we hear a booming voice telling us to get back. I charm the pants off her, she’s quite hungry-looking. Gwyn shares 3 rations and water.

The name of the drow girl is Hanne. She was seperated from her family when they were out Shea-Nassi (Dranaste knows that this is the main Drow city). She will come with us to the Dreedasesh Estate. Hopefully that’s not the wrong decision.

She mentions that her and her mother were after purple worm eggs - Dranaste is aware that these eggs are highly prized, and very valuable.

We’re making our way through a long tunnel, when suddenly the floor gives way at our feet, neither Hanne or I made our DEX save, and fall 25’ down to a floor beneath us. It looks like a purple worm had just passed through the cave, about 15’ above us, which caused the cavern floor cave in. Hanne and I are in a room with an exit at the other end.

As I use Steps of Night, Hanne runs after the worm. I call for help, Kereshi and Fuzula and the rest of the party drop down.

15’ high cavern with a bunch of fungus all over. Hanne has continued on to the next room. Gwynn runs oafter her, but falls down and slides down a steep incline because I faied my acrobatics check.

We’re now in a 35’ tall cavern, littered with the bones of dwarves, elves, etc. Hanne is set on getting an egg. 

We aid up.
- Hanne
- Kereshi
- Elinor

The ceiling of the next cavern is 80’ high. There are 7 clusters of purple worm eggs, each cluster of eggs has 6 eggs. 

“We can climb up there” - Hanne, and then she does. Dranaste heads over to the ropey stuff that’s holding the eggs together to start climbing up the rope.

11 drow enter the cavern, hunched over. The tension is rising, there’s a bit of a standoff as they fan out.

Hanne recognizes her mother in the group of 11 and calls out. The mother is named Zorra. I explain we found the daughter, and have been keeping her safe. We make our way back the way we came.

Zorra indicates 
- that Grinvah hasn’t been back in 10 years.
- [[Solral Dreedasesh]] is the matriarch
- Viconia is Grinvah’s wife. She lives in the main house.
- Benate-Der is another name for the city where the Dreedasesh estate is.
- She and 2 of her party travel with us, but not with us with us.

We find ourselves at a river of lava. To the right of us is the lava, on the left of us is the cavern wall. The path is 7-10’ wide. 

We notice something crawl out of the lava ahead of us. The thing has a snake-like body with a humanoid-like upper body, holding a spear. 2 more appear, he demands a toll in exchange for passage - 2 hours of work in the mines. Instead we trade them 10 gems.

After that, we stop 1/2 mile from the estate and wait for Zorra and her 2 partners to show up.
