## Session Log


Quest: [[SLD - Retrieve Necromancers Bane]]

- The party was able to kill the 4 stirges, [[Eljas]] finishing the last one off with a Toll the Dead cantrip. At one point, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] shot a tiny [[stirge]] attached to [[Olseris]] with its sharp pinchers and needle-like proboscis off with a trick-shot arrow.
- Trying to enter the north door, an alchemic trap was set off burning [[Elinor]], [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], and [[Eljas]]. As the three were being put out, the noise attracted the attention of the orc’s shaman and her assistants. Several other blood suckers from the stirges lair were attracted too.
- Heading down the fissure with stairs cut into it, the party wound their way into a large cavern with natural water flow. There are two tunnels leading out in addition to the water running under a low overhang.
- They headed left, following the tracks of barefooted humanoids.
- Finding the tunnel believed to have originally been created by the orc army to invade this place, defeating a trio of troglodytes, and freeing a bear, the party continued to explore.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] tested one of the three mixtures he found on the orc shaman. When thrown, the alchemist’s fire burned the wooden gate holding in the bear.
- They found a pair of ancient, moss covered dwarves. One had a beautiful long sword with [[Durgeddin]]’s mark seemingly untouched by time. The other had a beautiful steel helmet chased with silver (worth 110 gp).
- Our heroes continued down the tunnel they were on.
