## Session Log



Quest: [[Search and Rescue - Powell]]

- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] peeked into the room and saw 3 hobgoblins and a [[goblin]], although she wasn’t sure what the hobgoblins are.
- The largest sat on a throne and used a large chest as a foot rest.
- The party burst in the door, revealing another [[hobgoblin]].
- Elijas and [[Olseris]] took heavy damage, including [[Olseris]] being knocked unconscious briefly but the party dealt as much as they received.
- In the battle, [[Elinor]] cast the sleep spell that dropped [[Durnn]] the hobgoblin [[Goblin Boss]], [[Grenl]] the [[goblin]] shaman, and another [[hobgoblin]] soldier.
- [[Bronson]] killed one of the hobgoblins while it slept.
- [[Durnn]] and [[Grenl]] were tied up.
- [[Elinor]] dropped a light spell illuminated stone to the bottom of the shaft. She saw a skeletal figure approach it, move it with a rake, then move out of sight.
- Ultimately, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] dropped [[Durnn]] down an 80’ shaft. Just before he fell, [[Olseris]] saw that he wore one of the Powell signet rings.
- The party tried to convince the [[goblin]] shaman she should lead her tribe away from this place. She claims to put the safety of the tribe first as her highest priority. She doesn’t fear the goblins and considers it a favor [[Durnn]] was killed. [[Grenl]] may have been convinced [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] and party taught the kobolds how to make the dragon wyrmling work with them, or at least convinced her that [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] believes it. She must weigh the risk of staying vs the risk of leaving.
- [[Grenl]] said a man named [[Belak]], or the **Outcast**, was down the shaft. After killing one in a fit of rage, [[Durnn]] had sent the other two members of the Powell party down to [[Belak]]. She also said that if they went down there (i.e. was handed over to [[Belak|the Outcast]]), they can’t be saved.
- It was suggested if [[Grenl]] made sure they wouldn’t be attacked through the dungeon by goblins, the party could spare the goblins despite their deal with the kobolds. She said if she was set free she could communicate it to her other warrior goblins on this level.
- The [[Durbuluk Tribe]] has worked with [[Belak|the Outcast]] more closely since [[Durnn|Durnn’s]] arrival.
- The party had talked about going down after the signet ring and armor, but also since they are here for the “kids” and one of them is down there with [[Belak|the Outcast]]. When looking down the well,  [[Durnn]]’s body was no longer visible.

From Don:

The time between sessions will be seconds for the characters, but I'd hate to have the players spend all week thinking about what to do next and then get a more concise version of things at the beginning of the session that throws their thoughts in a tailspin. So I am sending this out ahead of our next session although it makes it a narration instead of a dialog.  Below is the information the goblin will relay at the beginning of the next session. Throughout the 'conversation,' [[Grenl]] would be looking at [[Eljas]], who spoke of the agreement with the kobolds, and [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]], who spoke like she was concerned about the tribe's safety. When she mentions the dragon, she would glance at [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]].  
  
***  
  I will look out for the safety of my tribe. You don't understand the risk of looking for a new home; especially leaving one this nice which we have lived in for decades. The kobold threat is less than the risk out there. We can't just move into a house outside of your town, now can we? But I would rather face the uncertainty out there to our childern with my remaining warriors than to face the kobolds without my warriors.  
1. If you are really willing to break your deal with the kobolds, I will spread the word that you have safe passage up here while you explore below. I will have gotten the word out in that time. The might of the goblins and kobolds can continue to work on each other for mastery of this citadel. You have weakened us a bunch, but I believe we can still overcome those dogs. I'm willing to give it a try.  
2. If you are really willing to break your deal and do the right thing, we could work together to expell the kobolds. If your trick to control the dragon works as you think it does, getting rid of us only lets them have the keep with an immense power. Together, we could defeat them by encouraging a group of them to pursue my warriors and we destroy them. Then attacking them where they rest on their pompous throne. Maybe your trick can be used to destroy the dragon.  
3. If you are actually intent on pushing us out so the newcomers can have our home, as I said we would sooner leave than have you kill our warriors one at a time. But it is not due to fear of the kobolds. If you are intent on freeing up the kobolds to settle into this keep, we will leave. Despite our differences, [[Durnn]] and the hobgoblins were mighty warriors. Without them, the remaining goblins can't stand against you, the kobolds, and the dragon without succumbing further to [[Belak|the Outcast]]. The oracles should record that the kobolds and their allies pushed out the [[Durbuluk Tribe]] in a few months under [[Durnn]]'s leadership though; not under mine.
