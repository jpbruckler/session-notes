#### Last Session Recap

![[038-20220523#^summary]]

## Session Log


- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] climbed through the tunnel above the hill.
- She was attacked by a giant spider, but killed it with her short sword.
- It's dead body landed on the normally unflappable [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]].
- While continuing through the shrine, they saw the withered, preserved form of a centaur with a beautiful pike. The mummified centaur began moving when [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] checked to see if the pike was separate. [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] began firing when the centaur began moving.
- There was also a stone statue of a giant wolf that turned to flesh when the centaur started to move.
- #ttrpg/treasure [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] took 10 pieces of jewelry worth 9 gp total. [[Hopeful]] and [[Elinor]] collected 35 gp and some sp of ancient origin.
- After bypassing a jade wall trap, [[Danger Inc.]]  came across a small room with a bronze trap door in the ceiling.
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] unlatched the trap door, which was forced open by 80 mph winds. [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] was unable to close the door, so everyone left the room in gale force winds.
- They entered a foyer with a wheel crank and a locking lever. The lever opened the floor, released a portcullis, and opened the door at the top of the stairs.  
- [[Elinor]] hears the familiar voice of [[Averos]] in her head say, "Madam [[Elinor]]. I hope you are safe and sound. I agreed to send another message. Let me know if you are looking for work." She responded that they were in a dungeon and asked if he knew about the [[Eternal Ones Mace|Eternal One's mace]] (which was the name the sunken eyed creature used when talking to [[Yusdrayl|Yusdrayl]]). She didn't get an immediate response.
- The top of the stairs opened up to a largely collapsed building. The back wall behind the alter was covered by a bas-relief of a giant wolf-thing, nine feet tall. On each side of it are blocks of stone that look almost like doors, but there are no visible signs to open them. A straw man lays flopped against the wall beside each door. ^wolfthing
- Reaching the top of the stairs, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] and [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] were frightened by an unrecognized terror; [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] momentarily scared stiff. Moments later, the scarecrows stood and attacked with sharp claws.
- One of the two suits of armor, empty except for a smoky form of orange energy, moved forward and slashed [[Elinor]] with its long sword. She barely retained consciousness.
- The battle continues.
    - Initiative is [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]], [[Elinor]], Scarecrows, [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]], Armor-dudes, [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]] , [[Hopeful]].

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 12:30 pm on Month 5/Day 27

P.S. [[Hopeful]]'s study of religions while at the [[30 TTRPG/33 Compendium/33.06 Locations/Mountain Sanctuary|Mountain Sanctuary]] allows her to recognize the shrine's origin. It is dedicated to [[Hiisi]], a powerful deity who is revered by evil beings. She believes that he would be more accurately described as a 'malicious forest spirit' than a murderous malcontent. But the clergy of the "Gods of Kalevala" paint him in an even darker light because of the evil his worshippers are often inspired to enact upon others.
