#### Last Session Recap

![[041-20210401#^summary]]

## Session Log



- Party reached crosspath, able to head south out of the [[Barrier Mountains]]
- [[Hopeful]] fell climbing down cliff after seeing a flying Plate Mail construct
- They took cover in a cave to avoid being seen by the construct. The next morning they found evidence seven bipedal, booted creatures were also traveled up to the trail head; probably flying or jumping to the top of the 30' sheer cliff
- Shortly after crossing the [[Musta River]], the party found a wagon and a cart without any owners present. It looked like the previous occupants were three adults and a pair of young children. One horse was present that was unconscious due to poisoning.
- Three giant wasps came back to the wagon while the party was still trying to wake the horse.
- The party had encountered giant wasps in this area before.
- After killing the wasps, [[Danger Inc.]] hunted down the nest and exterminated its inhabitants.
- Within the nest amongst the giant insect remnants and humanoid bones, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] and [[Elinor]] found the skeleton, from the waist down, of a man with a bag still present. In the bag was a membership card, a letter, and a pouch containing 26 gp, 23 sp, 6 cp, 3 citrine gems, and 1 amethyst gem.
- The [[Brotherhood ID Card]] has dull colors and an emblem in its center. The emblem is of a shield with grey hands holding it up. The shield depicts a clawed hand on its face. Below the emblem, a vertical bar lists three pairs of characters. For this card, the highest pair is stamped. At the top of the card, the word "[[Disciple Yarman|Yarman]]" is written in block letters.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 6 pm on Month 6/Day 1 

>[!quote] [[Disciple Yarman|Yarman]]'s Letter
>Dear [[Nebrizarre]], [[Knight of the Night]],
>
>It is with my deepest respect that I must decline your alliance. I mean no disrespect toward someone of your standing, but frankly, talk of the [[Eternal One]] is the fanciful dream of those who fantasize of power and the dark arts. [[The Prophet]] has made no reference to his existence nor any advantage gained for the [[The Three True Gods]] his reemergence. I will not waste my sect's resources chasing such dreams.
>
>If you have proof of the [[Eternal One]]'s existence and specific benefits that we can gain from an alliance, I assure you I wil consult [[The Prophet]]. His touched enlightenment will guide us in such murky decisions. I don't hold out hope that such proof will be forthcoming. The focus of my efforts will continue to be to bring equality to all; ensuring the people retain their control of the land even from the far side.
>
>Please understand it is out of respect that I state the situation so bluntly. According to the texts, long ago before his "ascension" [[Yethmoinen]] rightfully worshipped [[Hiisi]]. The many blessings that [[Hiisi]] grants me offers some standing to your request. But only the [[The Three True Gods]] have the power and it is an insult to them to work on others' behalf. Insults are dealt with decisively by the [[Hands]] through [[The Prophet]]. Not you nor your patron can draw my sect away from its mission.
>
>I wish you the best of luck in your own mission.

>Eternal brother,
>[[Disciple Yarman]]
>Site vice lead
