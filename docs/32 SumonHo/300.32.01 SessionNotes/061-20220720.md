## Session Log

We walk up the path from [[Strolbreln Tower]], which according to [[Olgann]] leads to [[Keg Torum]]. [[Dranaste]] leads the way.

The entrance is called [[Torum Needle]]

Kereshi hit for max damage twice, knocking the bad guy through the small balistrade

Kereshi looting:
17gp
27sp
a necklace worth 5gp

Kereshi - 4 javelins
Gwyn - heavy crossbow
Doffed plate armor, placed in bag of holding
Fuzula cast Pass Without a Trace from her bracers


as we make our way through the path, we come to a point where we see an orc encampment 50' away, bonfire
6 or so orcs, beyond them is a small, primitive city made of orcs, drow, hobgoblins, goblins - even an Ettin
Markings looked familar, but she wasn't able to place them. She doesn't think that they're from the [[Ravaged Lands]]


We end up finding a spiral staircase. Down there are glowy fungus, we see smoky tendrils of ash. [[Dranaste]] says we must prepare before entering the [[Undermist]]. The preparation is to cover our face with wet cloth. The Aid spell would keep people from taking damage.

[[ash whisperers]]


[[Ravaged Lands]] were called the [[Ravaged Lands|Conquered Lands]] post-Northern Invasion
