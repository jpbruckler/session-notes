#### Last Session Recap

![[057-20220412#^summary]]

## Session Log


- In the morning when the group awoke, they decided to spend the day relaxing and recovering.
- [[Argus]], finding himself without a spellbook after his capture, needed to head back to his home in the [[Confederation of Independent City-States|Confederation]] of Independent City-states, or [[Confederation of Independent City-States|CIC]].
- [[Hopeful]] decided to travel with him so he didn't have to go it alone in this dangerous place. She will catch up with the party later.
- Before Argus and [[Hopeful]] left in the early afternoon, [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] spent the morning reading part of The [[Perilous Realms]]; in particular the section on [[Nowhere]] and the [[Eternal One]]
- Not knowing exactly where the estate with the [[Penetration Stone|Penetration Stone]] is or where to look if they went to the [[Demons Door|Demon's Door]], they decided to search out the spy [[Olgann]]  mentioned who was captured by hill giants.
- Before long, [[Danger Inc.]]  came to a dilapidated tower that once served as advance notice and defense for the dwarven city.
- Rendered invisible by [[Elinor]], [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] went forward to investigate. She found a [[hill giant]] singing a mournful [and loud and sickly] tune of sorrow.      
- Pretending to be a talking bird, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] learned that the [[hill giant]]'s husband [[Hruk]] was taken by [[Chief Olgabrawn]]. She took all the husbands and ran off their spouses.
- The Chief took them to boss them around and make them bring her food. [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] said, "Isn't that your job?" The hill giant said, 'Yes, that is why it is so terrible.' She began balling again.
- The hill giant pointed out where the hill giant home is, roughly 90 minutes away.
- While traveling to their destination, the thick brush gave way to a group of gnolls and a chained troll. [[Elinor]]'s fireball and [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]'s words made them realize they were outmatched even by just four party members.
- [[Danger Inc.]]  reached the location of the hill giant home.
- ** Resembling a beaver dam, it straddles a river. The lower level of the den is lodged between two rocky outcroppings and made of piled timber packed with clay and mud. Above this piled timber foundation is a mud steading (a house made to giant scale) with a log roof. The structure is an impressive feat of engineering, well beyond the ability of hill giants to fabricate on their own. East of the steading is a yard enclosed by a 20-foot-high palisade wall made of logs lashed together with thick twine.
- The party considered their many options to enter the long house.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 11 am on Month 6/Day 29
