## Session Log

Quest: [[SLD - Retrieve Necromancers Bane]]

- After defeating the near-giant wasps, the party kept moving toward their destination.
- They left the more heavily traveled portion of the road, continuing on toward the [[Ravaged Lands.]]
- On the fourth day since leaving [[Fowlerville]], the party crossed the [[Musta River]], also known as Wyrm River. Further south Wyrm River runs between [[Aimesville]] and the monarch’s home; [[Dragons Coffin|Dragon's Coffin]].
- They considered a used shortsword of poor quality in the town on the east side of the bridge but chose to wait for a better deal.
- Later that day, a thug and his uncomfortable lackey tried to scam the party by donning tunics of the [[Seina]]. In a heated exchange, [[Olseris]] thwacked him with the flat of his glave when "Willie" called his partner-in-crime “such a half-breed". They were allowed to leave but the party kept the moderate-quality shortsword the half elf carried.
    - **[[Olseris]] is sensitive to racial prejudice and being the outsider.** The comment from "Willie" stung, all that he could see in that moment was all the people who had run him down. He couldn't help bit feel the newfound powers at his commadn - it was a struggle to keep them in check.
- Arriving at the [[Dancing Drake]] Inn, the barkeep Tucker pointed them in the direction of [[Averos]].
- [[Averos]] described the [[SLD]] as "purveyors of information, but also dedicated to keeping in check those who would create unlife and undeath. We have contracts and members beyond our own personnel." He wanted them to retrieve an item from the north which they "can expect about 3,000 gp" for from the [[SLD]]. They decided to talk through whether they wanted to work with the [[SLD|SLD]], and to what degree. For their partners/members rather than transational contracts, the [[SLD]] offers and receives information.  
- [[Bronson]]'s objective:   

!!! info
    Well, I want to know who someone is. Someone named “[[Knight Akleman]].” I found evidence that he or she ordered the kidnapping of Lord Townsend’s young daughter. The abductor ended up killing the girl when it was clear she would not be able to escape. I know nothing more than the note giving the order. I want to find this Akleman, but I don’t really know where to begin. 

 
- The next morning the group decided to work with [[Averos]] and the [[SLD]] as partners. They shared what information they knew from their recent travels, including the location/existence of the [[white dragon wyrmling]], the "binding site" description, and the unusual maroon-skinned undead that ran on all fours.
- It’s said that many of master smith [[Durgeddin]]'s creations are still hidden within [[Khandrukar]] despite it's fall centuries ago; and the [[SLD]] is confident that the [[Necomancers Bane]] is still held within the secret stronghold’s bosom. [[Khandrukar]] is in a formation called the [[Stone Tooth]] northwest of [[Blessingburg]].  
- [[SLD]] let the party use a ‘divining dagger’ attuned to the [[Necomancers Bane]] that will help you know when you get close. [[Necomancers Bane|The Necromancer's Bane]] is a warhammer in design, but empowered to defeat necromancers and their creations. 
- [[Olseris]] told [[Averos]] that [[Eljas]] would be the person to communicate with if needed.
- The party headed north for [[Blessingburg]] after lunch.
