#### Last Session Recap

![[028-20201015#^summary]]

## Session Log


- After [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] dropped the first 2 zombies and [[Elinor]] cast Entangle, more zombies appeared from the other room.
- After [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]] turned the undead, every one of them failed to resist his strength of will, [[Danger Inc.]]  defeated the 7 zombies and a wight. The wight fell through a hole in the floor to the basement below.
- The party headed to the second basement.
- The first room was a large meeting room of sorts.
- In the next room, the party fought the animated, skeletal remains of Rhonda Everson’s Grandpapa and 7 other skeletons.
- When Grandpapa was slain, a brief flash of dim crimson light appeared.  
- In a crate, [[Danger Inc.]]  found a [[Penetration Stone|Penetration Stone]]. [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] picked it up and stuffed it in [[Bronson]]’s backpack.    

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 9 pm on Month 4/Day 24
