!!! info "Session Summary: 010-20200423"
    We found [Sharwyn](app://obsidian.md/Sharwyn%20Powell), but she's not exactly in the best shape, [Belak](app://obsidian.md/Belak) was performing some cursed ritual to bind her to the [Gulthias Tree](app://obsidian.md/Gulthias%20Tree). [Danger Inc.](app://obsidian.md/Danger%20Inc.) decided the best thing they could do was to get [Sharwyn](app://obsidian.md/Sharwyn%20Powell) out of there, regardless of her willingness. Battle erupted.

## Session Log


Quest: [[Search and Rescue - Powell]]

- The party passed through an abandoned library. Within the library, a dragon scale bound book was found documenting dragon lore written in Draconic (worth 150gp to the right buyer). [[Bronson]] discovered a spell scroll mixed in with a few damaged papers and book parts. 
- On some stairs along the hallway, they found a [[goblin]] commoner dragging [[Durnn]]’s corpse. He said he found the corpse laying against the wall in the shaft garden. [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] found 17gp on it. The goblin agreed to take the party to [[Belak|the Outcast]] to parley.
- When they entered the room leading to the Twilight Grove, 4 goblin warriors were yelling at him. The party intimidated them, which led to [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] throwing a javelin at one. The party dispatched them. When the goblins called for help from the Protector of the Twilight Grove, all that came was three twig blights.
- They saw the eerie, evil [[Gulthias Tree]] was a dark, twisted thing that looked like a skeletal hand reaching up into the air.
- The party met [[Belak]]. He said, “Well, well. I wasn't expecting visitors. I'm surprised you got past the feuding up top. Can't wait to see my operation, huh. Well, you made it to where the real work is done.” [[Sharwyn Powell|Sharwyn]] didn’t want to leave with the party, and [[Belak]] stated “the compromise is for the humans of your group to stay with her; and work with me.” Soon after, battle began.
- During the fight, [[Belak]] used a wand that casts entangle, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] was almost swallowed by a [[giant frog]], [[Sir Braford]] was dropped like a sack of potatoes, [[Sharwyn Powell|Sharwyn]] used a spell similar to Blindness/Deafness on [[Olseris]], and she cast a light in [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]'s eyes while he swung on her. [[Elinor]], with some help from [[Olseris]] while blind, was trying to destroy the tree with Eldritch Blast.
- [[Bronson]] was amazed to learn that he could electrocute people with a touch, just like in a dream he had. He will share this with the group at the next convenient time.
- At this moment of interlude, [[Belak]] appears on his heels, [[Sharwyn Powell|Sharwyn]] seems to be retreating and a few twig blights are still in the combat. [[Olseris]] is still in the entangle spell area of effect.

Initiative order: 

1. [[Olseris]]
2. [[Belak]]
3. [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]
4. [[Bronson]]
5. [[Sharwyn Powell|Sharwyn]]
6. [[Eljas]]
7. [[Elinor]]
8. [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]
9. [[Twig Blight]]
