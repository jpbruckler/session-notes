#### Last Session Recap

## Session Log


Where we are:
- [[Aimesville]]

- After some debate, [[Danger Inc.]]  decided to go acquire an “access card” from the waiter.
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]] spent time at the [[Diancecht]] church in worship, visiting his mother, and serving those in need.
- Once the waiter was at work, [[Elinor]] and [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] went to his home.
- Using Disguise Self, [[Elinor]] looked like the waiter. She knocked on his locked door and one of his roommates opened it.
- After not finding the card near his bed, [[Elinor]] as the waiter left the home, dropped her spell, and put them (and the neighbor) to sleep.
- [[Elinor]] took a [[Brotherhood ID Card|cultist access card]] from the half-elf roommate.
- ” The cultist access card has dull colors and an emblem in its center. The emblem is of a shield with grey hands holding it up. The shield depicts a clawed hand on its face. Below the emblem, a vertical bar lists three pairs of characters. For this card, the lowest pair is stamped. There is room at the top of the card for a name or other letters, but none appear there.”
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] went looking for a Bag of Holding. He did find a “Dimensional Crevice” at the [[Exotic Object]] for sale for 5,000 gp.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] ended up with a Ring of Jumping for 600 gp purchased at a high-end shop.
- Later, [[Elinor]], [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]], and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] went to hire [[Booster]] to make a copy of the cultist access card. [[Booster]] turned out to be [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]’s long lost brother.
- [[Booster]], aka [[Booster|Lem Fastbritches]], agreed to make the card, make it with higher quality materials, and make it fast. He would have it ready in a few hours. [[Booster]] let the proprietor of the [[Exotic Object]] know he was leaving.
- Lem/[[Booster]] told [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] he could get a Bag of Holding for her. He was given 500 gp (300 from [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] and 200 from [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]) and said he could get the magic item in a day or two.
- The party met up again at the [[Home Comfort Inn]]. They decided to go visit the [[Everson Estate]] and would wait to decide what to do about the cultist meeting until they see how the estate goes.
- [[Elinor]] and [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]] approached the guard, convinced him to get the steward, who agreed to take [[Elinor]] alone to see Carter Everson.
- Carter’s wife, Rhonda, received a small inheritance from her grandfather who was an adventurer. It may have contained the [[Penetration Stone|Penetration Stone]]. However, that portion of the basement is sealed off behind an Arcane Lock because it is infested with undead.
- Carter Everson said the party could have the [[Penetration Stone|Penetration Stone]], if it is there, so long as they clear out the undead.
- Upon entering the first room behind a lock, the [[Danger Inc.]]  was attacked by 5 zombies and a faster undead with a sword and longbow.
