## Session Log


Quest: [[SLD - Retrieve Necromancers Bane]]

- [[Eljas]] healed the injured horse dropped by the [[griffon]].  
- Later that night at camp in the tall grass before the High Hills, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] did an excellent job hiding the cart and learned how she can cast the light cantrip.  
- [[Olseris]] detected a noise on shift. Firing an arrow with lit fletchings from [[Elinor]], he still couldn't see what it was in the tall grass. Stealthily sneaking close enough to see them, he saw that there were 6 lions meandering through.  
- That night [[Elinor]] also had a "powerfully moving dream."  
- Leaving the cart in its concealed location, the party left it hidden and took the horses with appropriate provisions as best they could (the draft horses don't have saddlebags).  
- They traveled the entire day and found the [[Stone Tooth]] in the evening. It was precisely 7:41 pm when the party headed up the mountain after tying the horses off with a long lead some 75 feet from the path.  
- The party reached the top of the trail up the mountain to find two orcs grumbling that "appear inattentive and bored." Impatient with the party's own quiet debate, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] and her bow took decisive action. The orc watch was taken by surprise.  
- As [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] and [[Eljas]] rushed into the opening to the [[Khandrukar]] to loot the body that didn't fall off the cliff, the rest of the party took up positions to see where the wide ledge "doubles back sharply into the mountainside."  
- Not to be outdone, the orcs posted behind the unnoticed arrow slits gained surprise of their own. The cover from the arrow slits was no protection against [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]'s bow and [[Elinor]]'s blast.  
- [[Eljas]] made good use of his scroll of command to make a protected orc flee.  
- Much of the party made it up the "marble steps cracked with age and veined with green moss [that] lead up to a strong double door of carved stone" which marks the entrance to [[Khandrukar]].  
- [[Olseris]] and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] made it through the doors onto a ledge with a rope bridge. An orc appeared through a secret door on the left. He looked surprised to see the party so he was presumably there to either lock the door or cross the rope bridge.  
  
The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 8:30 pm on Month 4/Day 09
