## Session Log



Quest: [[SLD - Retrieve Necromancers Bane]]

- The party headed back into the mountain at nightfall.
- Upon reaching the door by the Mountain Door’s arrowslits, it didn’t appear anyone had used the entrance since they left.
- [[Eljas]] checked the [[Divining Dagger]]. It began to glow faint blue again.
- After traveling along the same path they used before, giving a wide berth to where they were attacked by gricks, they reached the door to the stairs up into the hall with the lizardfolks.
- Upon finding the door unlocked and opening it, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] was slammed in the chest so hard with a log trap that she and the log crashed into [[Eljas]] behind her.
- After ascending the stairs and passing through the secret door behind the statue, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] and [[Eljas]] peered into the hall side-by-side.
- They saw “On the six sleeping pallets around the small fire, you see two dwarves with white beards and dull grey skin in scale mail armor. They are looking directly at you. Sleeping on the throne is a [[lizardfolk]] with his shield on his lap and his club leaning against his place of respite. Circled near the middle pillar on the north 5 kobolds are circled up, apparently doing some form of entertainment. They yip and laugh, seemingly on the verge of waking the lizardman from his slumber.”
- The dwarves, after checking to see no one else was looking, left the room without sounding any alarm.
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] kicked off the introductions with an arrow to the [[lizardfolk]]’s chest while he slept.
- As the party finished off those combatants, three other [[lizardfolk]] entered the room. A round later a [[lizardfolk shaman]], lizardman, and a more powerful lizardman (Lizardfolk Hunter) entered. The shaman conjured 8 constrictor snakes.
- [[Elinor]] delivered a well-placed entangle spell tying up a few snakes, a lizardman, and the Lizardfolk Hunter.
- After demanding the party surrender in a language they don’t undersand and thwacking [[Olseris]], seconds later with his allies having been eliminated the Lizardfolk Hunter bolted for the doors to the forge. [[Elinor]]’s thick vines on the ground slowed him up just enough for [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] to shoot him with an electric arrow.
- During a short rest, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] noticed the dwarves keeping an eye on the party. Luckily, the party didn’t take any of their stuff.
- After the rest, the next time his head poked out they waved him to come talk. He gestured to wait.
- Twenty minutes later, 2 dwarves stepped just into the room.
- In discussion, the Dwarves didn’t know where the hammer is, asked if the party knew where it was, and offered to evaluate the hammer for the party when they found it. The party does not plan to take them up on that offer.
- The party gave back the 2 tridents the Lizardfolk Hunter. A truce seemed to be established; the party stays out of the forge area and the dwarves leave them alone.
- [[Eljas]] was given the opportunity to look into the forge area from the door. He saw 5 dwarves. With a smile, the dwarf claimed that the “[[Dark Might]]” was a dragon, although he claimed to not know what kind or how old it was. He also said the waterfall down the passage/room fell into the dragon’s lair, although the whole of the complex could be considered its lair. However, when the lizardfolk and [[kobold]] servants went down to speak with and serve the [[Dark Might]], they didn’t go through this room.  
- The party headed through the door behind the throne. They found a council chamber with a large table. In this room, the [[Divining Dagger]]’s faint glow turned orange, indicating it was within 100 feet of the [[Necomancers Bane]].
- Through the only other exit, they found themselves in someone’s quarters. The large but spartan quarters had a bathing area and a closet. [[Olseris]] found a secret door in the closet.  
- The party kicked around [[Danger Inc.]]

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 11:30 pm on Month 4/Day 12
