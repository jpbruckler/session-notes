#### Last Session Recap

![[053-20210921#^summary]]

## Session Log


- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], alone again, found papers strewn around the room. They included official correspondence and a young would-be sage's notes. She shared her findings with the rest of the party.
- One letter written in a scribbled hand, directs the [[Keg Torum]] warden to put an artifact in the inner vault of the safe for security reasons. It describes the artifact as dangerous and shouldn't be handled more than necessary, but safeguarding it is necessary for the protection of [[Keg Torum]].
- Another letter (see below) describes the undead produced by the [[Penetration Stone]] (aka Crimson [[Penetration Stone|Power Stones]]).
- After showing the letters to the party, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] realized there was scraping on the other side of the wall.
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] went to a nearby unopened door off the main hall. Listening, he heard some movement in the room. [[Hopeful]]'s spider peered under the door with [[Hopeful]] sharing its senses. They saw four of the undead who move like chimpanzees with a humanoid like undead standing erect. Its thin but muscular form is covered in pitch black skin, but his chest and groin is covered by a thick crimson plate. His crimson hair on his head is short with little body hair. A shadow passed by the spider under the door then returned, causing it to return to [[Hopeful]] scared. [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] pushed on the door as something inside tried to open the door.
- With amazing grace and athleticism, [[Elinor]] pulled a piton from [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]]'s pack and wedged the door shut with it.
- Realizing the two rooms probably hold danger but the party is using its resources, they begun down the hallway leaving the rooms for later.
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], followed by [[Elinor]], headed down the hall. They reached another door, one of hardwood but reinforced with an unusual number of metal bands; 4 instead of 2.
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] called to the creatures down the hall but they didn't come out. [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] decided to test the door and found that it opened.
- Several zombies and 3 wights attacked the party from the hall. Their ruse to get the party to rush into harm's way failed, but they attacked with gusto (and hatred). One of the wights attacked with the zombies while the other two rushed in and out of the hallway taking shots at folks. Before the battle was over, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] was down to single digit hit points. In the ensuing battle, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], [[Elinor]], and later [[Hopeful]] ended up at the vault doors. [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] and [[Argon]] ended up in the dwarven armory.
- In the dwarven armory, [[Argon]] had found a ring among the papers, wood, cloth, and metal on the floor.
- [[Hopeful]] found a room with blue, green, black, and yellow walls. The wall colors didn't seem to have any purpose any longer.
- The party decided they were running low on resources and brainstormed ways to take a much needed rest. They settled on [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] using carpenter tools to drill a hole in the door with the common and goblin warnings, [[Elinor]] cast the Fly spell on [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]], [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] put the door blocks back, then [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] casts Misty Step to pass through the door (using the drill hole). It seemed to work well.
- DM THINKS THE GOBLINS WERE LEFT OUTSIDE WHEN DONE.
- [[Elinor]] ritual cast Detect Magic. The vault doors are magical, but the padlock isn't. She also found or verified the studded leather armor on the wight that looked like it had fine clothing on was magical. She also could tell there was magic behind the door off the big hall and three magic spots behind the scratched and gouged mural.
- While low on resources but not depleted, the party decided to clear the room off the main hall. They prepared themselves for [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] to open the door. [[Elinor]] would cast fireball (or Enemies Abound) into the room. The rest of the party was fanned out as well. [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] pulled the piton and went to pull open the door. However, it was locked. So she decided to kick it in.
  
Roll initiative!

    To myself: It is another day gone by. After tolling at my boring duties, I have spent another night deep in my readings. I have found some interesting information as I watch the sun rise. My father says I am a fool to spend so much of my share on my research. But these inquiries is all that keeps me sane at this post. Ever since that red [[Penetration Stone|power stone]] arrived 18 months ago, I have been intrigued by it (father would say obsessed). I once dreamed of writing papers and books for scholars, but I’m relegated to writing notes to myself. 
    
    It is surprising to learn that these [[Penetration Stone|power stones]] can produce different kinds of undeath. I’ve tried to tell father they are even more dangerous than he thinks, but he still thinks of my research as the machinations of a fable-intoxicated youth. He does still believe the rumors that the stones can raise the dead as skeletons like a common necromancy spell. He simply doesn’t believe that rituals can make them produce ghouls worthy of [[Orcus]]’s pride. But it is right there in ink and parchment.
    
    But these new revelations are amazing…and horrifying. Piecing together the texts and Trasman’s discoveries, they can also produce undead called Eternal Agents by some. They develop as 3 distinct products, very different from each other. All of them resist regular weapons, among other destructive forces, but are bothered by silvered blades.
    
    The lesser incarnation is a bestial creature, fast and blood-thirsty. They run on all fours and can climb sheer surfaces faster than a gnome can run across an open field. Crimson skin and dark black hair adds to the evilness of their look. It is haunting. And they hunt in packs, like wolves. Dying to one of these monsters, you could lose your own soul. For there is some reference to the unfortunate soul raised as a mere shadow.  
    
    The standard version looks a lot more like a human from the wild lands. It uses swords and sorcery rather than claws and bite. They are more cunning than the lesser version, but still simple. And they aren’t vulnerable to heavenly spells as the lesser version.
    
    The greater version is still a bit of a mystery. They are at least 3 dwarves in height and not very inventive. But also unflappable in their patience and pursuits, unusual for undead. But they can destroy life in a wink. Some find their abjuration spells difficult to overcome.
    
    Well, wish me luck. After being up all night, it will be hard to not be distracted while pretending to be a junior accountant; especially with such an amazing discovery.
