## Session Log


Quest: [[SLD - Retrieve Necromancers Bane]]

- The party settled down for the night with [[Elinor]] taking first watch.
- The black dragon, referred to as [[Dark Might]] by the dwarves, showed up in the camp with the [[Divining Dagger]]. [[Elinor]] used word acrobatics to avoid telling him what the magic dagger did. The party learned [[Yusdrayl|Yusdrayl]] had stolen the white dragon egg from the black dragon.
- After “convincing” the dragon she was not privy to the plan of the “evil trickster,” [[Elinor]] joined [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] with a status of “not on my list” to hunt down and destroy. [[Bronson]] “is definitely” on the list, despite being a poor shot. However, bringing [[Yusdrayl|Yusdrayl]] to the dragon will allow him to be granted forgiveness. “Too much food makes a dragon lazy,” so he wouldn’t bother destroying [[Bronson]], or the others, now.
- The travel was a miserable trip with heavy rain for most of the 2 days.
- During the trip, [[Averos]] used Sending to reach out to [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] with [[Eljas]] not responding. Three days later, [[Eljas]] had told him they planned to make a second push into the stronghold. [[Averos]] said he could be at the [[Dancing Drake]] in 4 days. Ultimately, the party communicated they had the [[Necomancers Bane]] and could meet [[Averos]] at the [[Dancing Drake]]. He ended the first message with, “You can respond in 25 words.” [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] responded to both messages with a simple and accurate, “Yes…” 
- The Power behind the Alter communicated with three members of the party for 1 minute. It asked them to “investigate the disappearance” of one of its beloved archers, [[Freddie]], who was himself in [[Blessingburg]] investigating the use of [[Penetration Stone]]. 
- The party has 2 days to figure it out without impacting their timeline to meet [[Averos]].
- [[Elinor]] joined a game of dice with a pair of farmhands for 1 roll.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] and [[Elinor]], separately, met the young men who were sent by [[Laidor]] to deliver his response to [[Elinor]].
- After receiving the message, [[Elinor]] was told they are leaving for [[Aimesville]] in the morning if she has a response.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] went over to meet the man in splint mail, [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]], who was also watching the motley crew of a party after they walked in. [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]] had met [[Freddie]] the night before but hadn’t seen him all day. [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]] mentioned that [[Freddie]] had the same violent tint to his fingernails that [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] does.
- The cleric of [[Diancecht]] joined the party at their table. [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]] mentioned that [[Freddie]] kept a journal or notebook of some kind. When the bartender wouldn’t open [[Freddie]]’s room until he was unaccounted for a few days despite the help the night before, [[Elinor]] picked the lock to his room.
- [[Elinor]] found [[Freddie]]’s notes under his bedding material. It was about 40 pages long and the last day’s entries said he was headed to the “Applegales,” a farm 45 minutes outside of town, “Tonight.”
- [[Danger Inc.|Damage Incorporated]] and [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]] waited until dark to head for the farm. At approximately 10 pm, they rendezvoused outside of the Griffin’s Nest to head out of town. [[Bronson]] left Judgement in the stables.
- At the Applegales Farm, the house and main barn had a large back field and smaller side fields on each side. Even the side fields were still over 100 feet wide. Woods surrounded the fields.
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]], with some later help from [[Bronson]], investigated the barn. There were 3 wagons in it that didn’t seem like they were part of the farm’s normal equipment, but no people were visible. The tracks of over a dozen people led through the back woods.
- Following the trail, the party passed along a few other fields over almost an hour’s trek. At the end, they reached a long abandoned wagon trail, an empty shed that had some blood in it, and a crevice caused by what looks like a collapsed mine. The sound of a wind instrument or eerie intone could be heard on the wind. 
- Down in the ravine a large, tan tent has been erected, roughly 15ft by 25ft. It is difficult to see much more through the darkness, foliage and rocks. Based on the limited shadows, you can tell there is at least one figure on the north side and several are on the south side, maybe as many as a dozen.  The chanting is coming from that area and a soft, dull red or crimson light escapes from under the tent.
- [[Bronson]] reminds the party what he saw at the first [[Binding Site]] when he went with the [[Seina]] to investigate the Crimson Column of light many had seen shooting up into the air. There was a weird maroon stone [[Penetration Stone|Penetration Stone]] that had seemed to meld into the ground. Across from it, there were eleven blackish spots roughly 2-3 feet in diameter that looked like the ground was burnt or stained. There were a few burned wagons found a half mile away in a clearing and the letter found there that included the first time you encountered the phrase “[[Binding Site]].” Finally, the [[Seina]] had a “short pitched battle with some ghouls.” (BTW, I didn’t explicitly mention the battle in play last Thursday. The [[ghoul]] quote is from a previous recap of what [[Bronson]] said after the expedition)
- The party began making preparations with confidence that this is the fate that has befallen [[Freddie]].
