## Session Log


Quest: [[SLD - Retrieve Necromancers Bane]]

- With the conclusion of the battle with the orcs, [[Eljas]] and [[Olseris]] went to check out the wagon, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] went to check out the assailants, [[Elinor]] went to check out the ditch, while [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] and [[Bronson]] stood watch.
    - [[Olseris]] found himself humming a tune that he's been hearing in his head unconciously since the orc fight. He's not sure that there's anything significant about the ditty itself, but it comes from the recesses of your mind that I tap into when I meditate on my patron.
    - Over the next couple of days, [[Olseris]] seemed more chipper (or at least less withdrawn) than usual." The less somber, nearly cheerful, mood lasts 2-3 days.
- Although bloody and with some wear showing (i.e. wheel spoke), the wagon was servicable.
- After [[Eljas]] and [[Bronson]] prepared and buried the farmers from the ditch, [[Christeria]] asked a spirit to heal damage to their bodies. She also mentioned that she was selling a potion to "give you strength equal to that of a brutish [[hill giant]]‚Äù for 230 gp.
- Dinner was a bland food evoked by [[Christeria]]. When she heard mention of the [[Stone Tooth]], she said "Oh, I know where that is".
- Over the next couple of days, [[Olseris]] seemed more chipper (or at least less withdrawn) than usual.
- They traveled on to [[Blessingburg]].
- In [[Blessingburg]], [[Olseris]] told the guard about the [[Tear Bringers]] orcs, sold the found wagon (10 gp), sold the captured armor and arms (93 gp), purchased some items including a pully & an 8' collapsable pole, and got basic directions to the [[Stone Tooth]].
- [[Elinor]] sent Laider a letter asking if he knows how to reach Michael. She sent it via a local carrier named Antonio.
- After [[Eljas]] freshed up with an ale, they hit the road again; leaving [[Blessingburg]] around 3 pm.
- The next 24 hours were uneventful.
 - The evening after leaving [[Blessingburg]], "Looking around for what spooked Cassiel, you hear a loud screech like a [[giant eagle]]. Your heads snap toward the sound to see a few aerial monstrosities flying at you. Large monsters that look like eagles barrel down at you. But you also notice that the trailing portion of them looks more like a lion."
- Two tried to take one of the cart's draft horses and the other, which had been hit a few times on the approach, attacked [[Eljas]]. When the horse was free from the cart with significant damage to the harness, one of the griffons tried to fly away with it. The other went after [[Bronson#Judgment]] ([[Bronson]]'s warhorse) who had less people around it.
- [[Bronson]] succumbed to claws/beak injuries and fell off the horse, but [[Eljas]] healed him. Both the griffons still in combat were killed. Arrows from long bows were just enough to kill the last [[griffon]]. The horse didn't die, but it is badly damaged.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 6 pm on Month 4/Day 08
