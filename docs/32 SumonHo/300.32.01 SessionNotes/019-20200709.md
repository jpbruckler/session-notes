## Session Log



Quest: [[SLD - Retrieve Necromancers Bane]]

- [[Elinor]] quit concentrating on the Entangle spell so the party could chase after the escaping orc.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] and [[Bronson]] moved forward after the orc down a hallway being careful not to rush ahead of the rest of the party. [[Elinor]] and [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] trailed behind, keeping a little distance between themselves and the ‘front-line fighters.’ [[Olseris]], with [[Eljas]] following for safety, went in a different direction to investigate the door the escaping orc had come from. While in there, [[Olseris]] found 210 gp in a cauldron and a pouch of 3 gems.   
- The group following the orc came to a room with 5 exits, including a cave to hold prisoners. It was occupied by 2 humans. They were exceedingly happy to be saved! The orcs had been trying to ransom them back to their village.
- As [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] went to free the prisoners and [[Bronson]] tried to support while providing cover over the 5 exits, a set of double doors opened to the west. [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] killed the orc who opened it.  
- With [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] still made an attempt to free the prisoners, but after a quick failed attempt he moved to the hallway to keep the orcs off of [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]].
- A large, part-orc leader (under the Great Ulfe) with 5 orcs, including the one the party was searching for, came out of the door and attacked. The attackers surrounded and overwhelmed [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]’s already damaged and exhausted state. 
- The first three orcs were dropped by [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] (2) and [[Elinor]] (1) before [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] succumbed to his wounds despite her relentless endurance. [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] and [[Elinor]] ended up toe-to-toe on the front line while [[Olseris]] and [[Eljas]] were nowhere to be seen. Before long, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] was bleeding out quickly (with 2 failed death saves to 0 successful ones).
- [[Elinor]] stepped between two impressive assailants to cure [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] of some of her wounds.
- [[Olseris]] sprinted out of nowhere to land a near-perfect shot on the cursed leader. Having been damaged by [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] and [[Bronson]] already, the leader also fell to the overwhelming damage. After that, the party quickly dispatched the remaining orcs. A potion was found on the leader.
- After releasing the prisoners, they were given some food by [[Eljas]] and pointed the way out. With the bridge rendered unusable, it is uncertain what happened to them.
- The party took a long rest in the secret hallway in order to recuperate from a long day’s travel and the recent battles. During the long rest, [[Bronson]] cast Find Familiar to reform Cassiel into a weasel.
- After searching through the main storage area, and finding the part-orc leader’s stash of 180 gp and a flask of holy water.
- Searching a few other rooms, the party realized that the bodies were moved and the beds were likely slept in just outside the prisoner’s cave.
- They came across a gate stuffed with blankets, hay pallets, and even flour bags. It had a grand stair that went down and a door at each end of the room (and several old skeletons). After [[Elinor]] picked the lock, the party entered and headed toward the stairs. A buzzing noise came from the stairs. As [[Olseris]] began to creep down the stairs, silhouetted by [[Eljas]]’s light, **“four things resembling insectoid bats emerged from the stairwell”** and flew at the group.

**Roll Initiative!**
