#### Last Session Recap

![[040-20210318#^summary]]

## Session Log



- Most of the party members made it past the snake before it coiled. The 3 giant snakes were generally aggressive toward the party but not interested in pursuing them while digesting a recent meal of baboons.
- Thanks to [[Hopeful]]'s use of thaumaturgy, there was enough distance between the groups to keep their distance.
- A couple hours later, [[Danger Inc.]] encountered seven monstrosities that [[Hopeful]] referred to as "[[Heart Eaters]]". She said it is a terrifying fate to be overpowered by one.
- A well, placed Enemies Abound spell by [[Elinor]] kept some of the fight away from the party.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] used his ring of jumping to leap up onto one of the monsters. He struck critically with the [[Soulstriker|Soul Striker]] to devastating effect.
- While the vicious [[peryton]] (their technical name) barely made it to the party, their own critical hit during a diving attack brought [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] 'within an inch' of losing her life (or at least her consciousness). [[Hopeful]] was pretty beat up as well.
- Following the encounter, the party took a long rest on a wide point in the path calling it an early night. During the rest, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] attuned to the weapon known as [[Soulstriker|Soul Striker]].
- [[Danger Inc.]] were back on the move around 2 or 3 am. The bright moon was sufficient to provide dim light for [[Elinor]] this evening.
- As the sun came up, [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] saw a dozen or so humanoids, likely humans, walk in a huge valley below them accompanied by 2 giant snakes. They had colorful clothes and walked alertly armed with long-spears, swords, and short bows.  
- The party ignored them and pressed on west along the trail.
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] determined by the landscape that the party is just inside the [[Barrier Mountains]] north of [[Aimesland]].
- The party strongly considered turning south and climbing the mountains at [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]'s urging. Ultimately, the task was decided to be too daunting. They would keep an eye out for a spot that may be reasonable.   
- Several hours later the party stumbled upon two wyverns amongst the local goats. She knew them to be aggressive, powerful creatures but unlikely to fight to the death unless starving. [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] fired upon them before they took the opportunity to close for an attack. In a short but hard fight, half the party was severely injured.
- One tried to grab [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]] , the halfling, to take her with it in its retreat. It couldn't get a grip on her and was killed before it could escape. [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] had found herself in the front and took another critically placed bite.
- The party was catching their breath at the close of the session. 

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 1 pm on Month 5/Day 28
