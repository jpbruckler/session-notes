"I probably should have gone straight back to the temple instead of coming to [[The Green Tankard]] with those adventurers." 

You're in a room at [[The Green Tankard]] after riding for hours back to [[Vendare]]. Your bones are sore and you're battle weary, but you feel a great sense of accomplishment having put [[Sakatha]] in his place.

You remove your armor and weapons, wash your face in the basin, and settle down to thank [[Tymora]] for her guidance and luck during your most recent adventure.

You close your eyes and focus on bringing to mind a picture of a face-up silver coin with the Goddess's face and flowing hair embossed on the front - [[Tymora]]'s most common holy symbol.

As the picture wholly forms in your mind, you feel a touch on your shoulder. Startled your turn around and your eyes go wide as you see who is standing before you - the Smiling Lady herself - [[Tymora]].

"You've been one of my favorite clerics since you entered the faith, you know."

Stunned, you don't answer immediately. [[Tymora]] smiles.

"I think you're going to do great things if you continue on with your current companions. I would urge you to seek to become a permanent member of their group. Maggie, you've a bit of my own luck - use it. Spread my name in [[Waterdeep]]. There will come a time when you find someone choosing responsibility over chasing their dream. Do all that you can to encourage them to follow their dream so that they might be happy."

She reaches out and touches your forehead, and for a moment you're filled with warmth. Just as suddenly as she appeared, she leaves you.
