# [[The Dinner]]

The evening of the dinner arrives. [[Tandaleia Deleamintaviglia|Maggie]], [[Tsakor]], [[Hani Wildheart|Hani]], and [[Eris]], dressed in their finest, all make their way to the front of Castle Vendare, expecting to see one of the Count's carriages waiting for them. Instead they are greeted by a large covered carriage. Roughly square in shape, the exterior wood paneling has lacquered in a glossy black. A delicate filigree in gold leaf is painted on both sides of the carriage, and each of the 4 lanterns that hang from its corners sit on polished brass pedastals.

The carriage is drawn by 2 completely black horses, easily 15 hands high. Their manes and tails in intricate braids, with black leather tack adorned with brass tacks all along it. They stand in the night air, steam rising from their bodies and stamping their hooves as though their only desire is to be off running again.

The driver sits atop the carraige in a fine deep purple coat and tri-corn hat. The carriage door is open, and 2 of the Count's footmen help you all inside. The interior is just as fine as the exterior. The seats are upholstered in a deep brown leather, buttoned to form a diamond pattern across them. There are windows to the rear and sides. At each window is a short curtain for privacy.

Once you're all in and settled, you hear a crack of a whip and the sound of steel-shoed hooves on cobblestone as the carriage lurches forward.

In what seems like no time at all the carriage is slowing to a stop. Pulling back the curtains you see a large white mansion before you, with blue tile roof. The doors to the carriage are opened by footmen wearing deep purple coats, white undershirts, white gloves and black patent leather shoes.

As you step out of the carriage you note that at least 2 hours have passed since you left Castle Vendare, though it seemed like only a few minutes ride. It's now fully dark, and the outside of the  [[Chateau Le Scouzec]] is lit with a slightly bluish light, though there's no obvious light source.

The butler introduces himself as [[Gabrielle Langlaise]] with a deep bow. He has fine features and pale skin, his eyes are a very light blue. It's hard to tell how old (or young?) he is, but he has a welcoming manor and any strangeness you had concerning the apparent discrepancy in time fades away as he greets you all warmly and leads you into the ch√¢teau. 

"[[Gwit'hlan Scouzec|Lord Scouzec]]" (skwuh-zey-k) will be down shortly, please allow me to take your coats and make you comfortable."

He snaps his fingers and 4 servants come forward to help you all with your coats and you're led through to a waiting room where spiced wine is served along with some hors d'oeuvres - thinly sliced cucumber with a dill sauce on top of thin crackers, cranberry-fig goat cheese crostini, and bacon wrapped water chestnuts. A roaring fire is in the fireplace, and the chill of the early autumn evening finds no purchase in the room.

About 20 minutes later the [[Gabrielle Langlaise|butler]] raps the door and announces:

    "Your distinguished host, Lord [[Gwit'hlan Scouzec]], Magister of Menloth, Keeper of the Flame of Arnoch, First of the Seven!"

A tall man enters the room. He is dressed in a dark navy robe that looks like padded satin with an embroidered pattern on it. Beneath the robe, dark pants, a cream colored shirt, and black boots show. [[Gwit'hlan Scouzec|Lord Scouzec]] is dark skinned, with white hair. Pointed ears peak from beneath his long hair. The sudden realization that you're in the home of a Drow Lord hits you.

[[Gwit'hlan Scouzec|Gwit'hlan]] smiles at you, and you're all a bit surprised to find that it feels like a genuine smile of welcome - something you weren't sure a Drow would ever be able to muster.

    "I see that 2 of your number couldn't make it -"

At this point [[Eris]] is sure that the missing members of the party would be perceived as some slight.

    "- but [[Goradaar Delmirev|Master Delmirev]] no doubt is caught up with his research, and I'm given to understand [[Gwenith Serena|Misstress Serena]] has recently turned her attention to the care of the forest in your new barony. You all have very recently been presented with many more demands of your time, and so I'm honored that the majority of you were able to attend."

The slight anxiety creeping up inside of [[Eris]] at the thought of starting the evening by offending their host subsides.

    "Shall we go through to dinner? I'd love to hear of your adventures direct from you."

You follow [[Gwit'hlan Scouzec|Lord Scouzec]] through into the dining hall. The table is large enough to seat at least 30 people, though only 5 places are set. The head of the table, and 2 places on either side. As you are shown to your seats you're able to take in the room that you're in.

The room is rectangular in shape, and 4 pillars are built into each of the longer walls. The shorter walls both have cathedral style windows in them. Following the pillars up, you would expect to see a cathedral style ceiling - instead what you see is a night sky lit up with twinkling stars, a moon, and the occasional shooting star.

Your host is a practiced one, and between the spiced wine, the rich food, the warmth of the fire and his gracious nature you wile away the hours with stories of your exploits assisting the Count and driving out [[Sakatha]].

!!! note
    Charisma checks needed from everyone attending.
    - Failing the check means that the interaction with the [[Halaster Blackcloak|Mad Mage]] is revealed
    - A successful check means that detail is kept to yourselves

As the conversation starts to slow and the dinner plates are cleared away, there is a slight change in [[Gwit'hlan Scouzec|Gwit'hlan]]'s demeanor that [[Tandaleia Deleamintaviglia|Maggie]] picks up on.

    "Well then, to business. The terms of the dinner were to discuss the price of the [Sovereign Glue](https://ddb.ac/magic-items/sovereign-glue) within my possession. Before I knew who was searching for it I would have been willing to part with it for gold. It would seem a waste to barter such a thing away for gold when I have an opportunity for something much more valuable to me - a favor."

[[Gwit'hlan Scouzec|Gwit'hlan]] lays out the following:

- He is, in fact a Drow, though he's lived above ground for the last 150 years. He is without heir, and has lost any hope of reclaiming a position in Drow society.
- He's done his homework and knows that [[Tsakor]], Hani, [[Gwenith Serena|Gwen]] and Goradaar originally hail from [[Waterdeep]].
- He explains that there is another drow house in Undermountain that he would prefer to see... handled. In exchange for the promise of dismantling [[House Auvryndar]], he would provide the [Soverign Glue](https://ddb.ac/magic-items/soverign-glue), some [Universal Solvent](https://ddb.ac/magic-items/universal-solvent), and 2 [Sending Stones](https://ddb.ac/magic-items/sending-stone)  which you would be able to use to inform him when [[House Auvryndar]] has been dispatched.

Please respond with your answer (yes, no, counteroffer) and:

- 1 charisma check each to determine if anyone talks about the [[Halaster Blackcloak|Mad Mage]] during dinner
- 1 charisma check if you decided to answer with anything other than a 'yes' to Scouzec's offer.
