Jaffe shows you to your room in [[The Green Tankard]], where you collapse upon the bed. It's late, you've been riding for hours to get back to [[Vendare]], and your muscles are sore. Sleeping for the next week seems like the best idea ever. You sluff off your armor and drop into the bed, asleep before your head even hits the pillow.

You find yourself in a place that is black as far as you can see in all directions. The only light comes from a small brazier in front of you. The air smells of incenseÂ and roses, and though you know not where you are, you feel at peace here. The voice of [[Hun-Hoksa]] fills your head:

    "You've done well for yourself. [[Sakatha]] was a great blight on this land and his destruction pleases me. I know you and your companions were concerned about the fiends' brides, but they were destroyed when he fell. I'm proud of you and the progress you've made.
    
    You've overcome a great challenge - [[Sakatha]] was an ancient undead. Your determination has been noticed and now will be rewarded."

As the last sentence forms in your mind, a softly glowing unicorn appears before you, touching its horn to your chest.

The vision fades after that, and you sleep a deep and restful sleep. 

A feat has been added to your character sheet called "Blessing of the Unyielding".

!!! info "Blessing of the Unyielding"
    You gain a boon to your attributes, the ability to sustain some level of exhaustion, and additional endurance. Your tenacity in battle to further your patron's ideals have been noticed. Your patron bestows a blessing that most befits someone with your gritty determination.
    
    You increase one of your ability scores by 1 (not to exceed 20). You always subtract 1 from your current level of exhaustion. You gain 1 additional hit point for each level you have currently have, and an additional hit point for each level you gain in the future.
