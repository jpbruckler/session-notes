Horseback riding has always afforded your brain some time to work on ideas. While the rest of the party seemed to find the rather long journey from the swamp exhausting, you found it was a nice time to put your thoughts in order on your experiments with creature specimens.

Your experiments have shown that most specimens can be divided up in the following categories:

- Solvents
	- These will disolve, thin, or otherwise modify normal components, and is one of the main ways to process a raw ingredient into the active reagent that causes a particular reaction or effect.
- Binders
	- These alter the viscosity of liquid ingredients, making them thicker. Certain binders can also hold multiple solid ingredients together in such a way that they form a new ingredient alltogether.
- Reagents
	- These are the "things" the cause the action of an alchemical concoction.
- Colloids
	- These substances are useful for holding other fine ingredients in a solution for long periods of time without the ingredients separating out.

You believe that you've worked out a formula to achieve 2 effects:

1. Fire Grease
   Fire grease can be applied to the blade of a weapon to add 1d4 Fire damage when a creature is hit with a melee attack.
2. Acid Fog
   Acid fog is poured out onto the ground (or from a broken vial) into an area. Within 3 rounds it will spread to a 30' radius causing 1d4 Acid damage to all creatures at the beginning of their turn while in the fog, and will continue causing 1d4 Acid damage for 2 rounds after a creature has left the fog.

Each of these requires 10gp and 8 hours to process. In addition to the components, you will need access to Alchemy tools, an Herbalism Kit, and Smith's tools.
