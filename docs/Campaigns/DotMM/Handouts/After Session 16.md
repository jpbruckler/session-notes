    For the purposes of this note, [[016-20220913]] will be assumed to be the day that the party spoke with [[John Brunis]], the [[John Brunis|Count of Eor]]. The 2 weeks of downtime was partially covered with the part of the session where people were looking for magic items, shopping, etc.
    
    What follows is a description of things the party did, set in motion, etc; during the 2 weeks of downtime. Much of this is "flavor", and only exists for the purposes of storytelling.

## Chapter 1: The Feast

After meeting with the Count ([[John Brunis]]), and receiving accolades, titles, and land, the parties' heads were swimming a bit in the new found fame. They never set out to become nobility (it's fair to say that becoming a noble wasn't something that [[Gwenith Serena|Gwen]] had ever thought about, except maybe in a bad dream), yet here they were. Sore and still tired from hours of hard riding, a feast, however, was very much a welcome thought.

The castle chamberlain (whom the party are now formally introduced to - his name is [[Ryland Saing]]) sees to the party's various requests. As they are relayed to him, an adolescent girl keeps notes on the requests. He never raises an eyebrow or makes a face at anything the party asks for, and gives no outward indication of how he feels about the new nobility. 

Once the requests have been made, [[Ryland Saing|Ryland]] informs the party that their belongings have been moved from [[The Green Tankard]] into rooms within the Castle, as befitting their new rank. 

!!! info Party Insight
    [[Eris]] - you note that many of the people within the castle walls are armed, even those sitting close to the count. Not so many that the unarmed person looks out of place, but you get the sense that the Count is a pragmatic man, and one used to fighting, or at least one used to needing to have a blade handy. That sense of pragmatism extends to how the castle is run, there's less an air of "high court" and more an air of military precision.

Many of the members of [[The Legion of the Emerald Goat]] have been on the outskirts of social status for much of their lives, so being thrust into the limelight, handed land and titles, while certainly exciting, didn't immediately sink in. As the day goes on it becomes more apparent how much of a shift this will be for the party. Making their way through the streets they're stopped more than once by folks whom the party's actions had impacted for the better. Discounts were freely given at merchants, children looked upon the party with awe as they walked past, it was a lot to take in.

The afternoon soon faded to evening and the members of the party all found themselves seated on either side of the count at the head table during the feast. The feast took place outside the palace, nobility and commoner alike were invited to attend. Before the food was brought out, the Count formally introduced the party as the new [[The Legion of the Emerald Goat|Barons of Aldwulf]], which was met with a round of applause by everyone gathered.

The mead and food flowed freely, and during the dinner several bards told tales about the history of [[Vendare]], the troubles they'd had with [[Sakatha]], and all manner of tales of derring-do. At one point the party was surprised to see [[Pluck]], the minstrel they met while on the road to [[Sakatha]]'s lair, was there. He sang a ballad he had written about the party, felling a dragon, braving the dangers of the swamp, laying low the host of fiends that fought in [[Sakatha]]'s name. 

The feast went on well into the evening. When the party finally retired to their rooms they did so with red noses, full bellies, and smiles on their faces.

## Chapter 2: The First Week

The next morning the new Barons awoke with the sun and made their way to the great hall to eat and plan their day. As they discussed their plans, [[Ryland Saing]] approached to inform them that buyers had been engaged on the party members' behalf to find any leads on magic items in the area. 

He also informed the party that the refugees that they had liberated from [[Sakatha]], as well as nearly 100 more men, women, and children that had been rounded up from nearby bandit camps were expected back in the city within the next day or so.


### Eris

[[Eris]] was provided with economic and cultural details regarding the [[Barony of Aldwulf]], as well as some brief history of how the Barony came to be founded, and some details regarding the requirements the Barons would owe the Count.

They were also introduced to [[Tarik Delad]], the current steward of the Aldwulf estate. Tarik was happy to see that the Aldwulf barony would once again be occupied by people who had done much for the inhabitants of [[Vendare]].

Tarik is quite old, approching his 78th year, and with no heirs. 

### Goradaar

The proprietor of "Aqa Vitae", and alchemical shop specializing in potions and elixers for the affluent had agreed to sharing his laboratory space, stating tat he would be honored to work alongside one of the [[The Legion of the Emerald Goat|Heroes of Vendare]].

The time spent in the lab was very fruitful. During the first few days [[Goradaar Delmirev|Goradaar]] was able to prove his hypothesis regarding the use of monster biologial material in the production of new alchemical concoctions, and within the next couple of days was able to create:

- 2 vials of Fire Grease
- 1 vial of Acid Fog


### Gwen

[[Gwenith Serena|Gwen]] found a jeweller that made her a necklace and a circlet of silver and brass shaped like mistletoe in exchange for some of the gems she had.

During this week she spent a good deal of time outside of the immediate city, preferring the company of nature to the hustle and bustle of a city. Leaving the castle and city early in the morning and spending time in the wilderness working on her form with the scimitar and wild shaping into all manner of beasts. 

During one of her excursions she happened upon an old man resting on a stump just off of a deer trail. When she approached he introduced himself as [[Gwit'hlan Le Scouzec]], the local druid. Gwen and he spoke for several days, and over the course of the conversations she found that there is a Druid Grove in the Barony of Aldwulf that has been without a Druid to keep it for the last 30 years. Gwit'hlan had been tending it up until a year ago when it became too much travel for him.

The grove is ancient, the tree at the center being well over 1,500 years old. The old druid is sure that the grove is healthy, but wondered if Gwen would be able to look in on it, as she's been made a Baron of the area.

### Maggie

[[Tandaleia Deleamintaviglia|Maggie]] was called to Jorlon's study on the third day after the feast. When she arrived, [[Jorlon]] smiled at her - a rather uncharacteristic response to her presence. On his desk was a box made of a dark wood. A likeness of [[Tymora]] had been inlaid on the top of the box in mother of pearl with gold accents.
  
Jorlon explained that he had heard of Maggie's request to find a Devotee's Censer to take with her on this new path she had been set upon. In the box was the Censer, Jorlon's most prized possession. He explained that it was given to him when he set out during his younger years in support of military operations in the region by the then High Priest of the church.
  
> "A week ago I would never have dreamed I'd be passing it on to you, of all the Lady's clerics. I can't deny though that you have been
> changed by this business with Sakatha. You have a purpose about you, and I can think of no better owner for it than you."
  
Maggie was moved by the gesture, and insisted on making a donation to the church to the tune of 14,000gp.


### Tsakor

The chamberlain informed [[Tsakor]] that the man he was looking for had been located already. His name is [[Quinn Crewe]], and he could be brought to the castle if Tsakor preferred. Otherwise he could be found near the outskirts of town where some temporary lodging had been erected for refugees that had made their way to the city.

[[Tsakor]] declined to have hiom brought to the castle and instead took a walk through [[Vendare]], making his way to the refugee camp. Asking around and with a description of [[Quinn Crewe|Quinn]] he was eventually able to find him.
