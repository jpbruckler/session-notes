    Past the doors you cannot find.
    Down the steps you cannot climb,
    And across the River of Nothingness
    You'll find your way.
    Beware the marsksman and his prey.
    Shun the royal brides!
    Then find the place I lie in eternal feast!
    Past glories I despose;
    The light of vengeance fillls my eye.
    Treasure I give my servant dragon,
    Guardian loyal of this, my reborn feeding lair
