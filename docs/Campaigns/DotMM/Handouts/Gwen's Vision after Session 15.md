# [[Gwen's Vision after Session 15]]

A hard day of riding and horse switching has you exhausted, sore, and oblivious to the goings-on around you. Arriving at [[The Green Tankard]], you follow the rest of the party up to your rooms, drop your stuff on the floor as soon as you get into the room and collapse on the bed - you're so tired you don't even mind that it's not a bed of furs and pine boughs - you'll even sleep on what passes for comfortable in civilization. You're asleep almost as soon as your head hits the pillow.

  

"Gwen."

  

"Gwen."

  

"Gwen!"

  

You stir to see what the fuss is about. A man stands before you in the forest. His face is beautiful in an ethereal way - you can't quite put your finger on his heritage, hut you think he's Fey of some kind. His hair is fire - no, not actual fire you notice, but hair all the colors of flame that moves and waves unnaturally. His cloak, too, appears in the colors of fire, reds, yellows, oranges, all swirling together, but it appears to be made of... feathers?

  

"I don't have much time, it costs me so much to appear to you, this time I chose a form that might be more recognizable."

  

For the briefest of seconds his form shifts from one of a man to one of a bird, and you recognize him from the vision you had of the great bird calling your name.

  

"You've met my captor. I fear I'm running out of time, please make haste to Undermountain. I don't know why we seem to be able to find each other, but I think you must be my last chance at freedom."

  

Just as suddenly as it began, the vision is over. You awake. It's the middle of the night, you're in your rooms at [[The Green Tankard]], and the moon is still high in the night sky. 

  

"Well that was interesting. Another mystery that can wait until the morning." you think then go back to the deep sleep of one whos is truly tired.
