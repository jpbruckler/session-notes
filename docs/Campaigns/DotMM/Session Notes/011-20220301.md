## Session Log

- The session opened with a battle with a fully plate-mailed cleric - [[Patriarch Ul-Lon]]. Ul Lon turned his staff into a snake, and the pair went on the offensive. During the fight, [[Tandaleia Deleamintaviglia|Maggie]] destroyed the summoned snake, which upset the [[Patriarch Ul-Lon|Patriarch]] - causing him to yell angrily at [[Tandaleia Deleamintaviglia|Maggie]].
- Other cultists came from their rooms to support the Patriarch. Coupled with the cramped space, made this one of the more challenging fights for [[The Legion of the Emerald Goat|The Legion]].
- [[Tandaleia Deleamintaviglia|Maggie]] then went on to kill the [[Patriarch Ul-Lon|Patriarch]], and said, as he died:

- She then proceeded to heal the party for a total of 140 HP
- [[Hani Wildheart|Hani]] helped herself to 2 silver candelabra (600gp) from the Patriarch's chambers
- The party, not heeding concers from [[Tandaleia Deleamintaviglia|Maggie]] that it would behoove them to rest, continued exploring the chamber, finding a secret door leading to a chest containing:
    - 5000gp 
    - 2000pp
    - A small cylindrical ivory case with an ivory stopper in one end ([[Goradaar Delmirev|Goradaar]])
- The party took a long rest after locking themselves as best they could into the temple room.
