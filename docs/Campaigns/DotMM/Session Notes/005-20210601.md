## Session Log

- Spent a few days in [[The Green Tankard]] waiting for an audience with the count
- Party was retrieved by a Page and led to the [[Palace of Eor]] to meet [[Jorlon]] and [[John Brunis|John Brunis, Count of Eor]]
    -   When asked by the court Steward, [[Tsakor]] gave their name as “**[[The Legion of the Emerald Goat]]**”
- The Party decided take up the count on his quest - his men have gone missing and there are brigands attacking the merchants in the area. Maybe because they wanted to help, or maybe because the wand they came after was promised as a reward to the party
- After accepting the quest the party requested the following equipment from the Steward:
    - Cart with 2 Draft horses
    - 1 Breastplate
    - 1 Scimitar
    - 50 Rations (25gp)
    - Longsword
    - 2 potions of healing
    - 5 sets of fine clothing
- [[Tsakor]] and [[Gwenith Serena]] tried to gather some information from the merchants gathered in the palace and were able to determine:
    - The attacks recently have been near [[Newcombe]], but started near [[Waycombe]] and [[The Great Southern Swamp]]
    - Merchant’s guards always seem to run away
    - The Brigands:
        - Look like normal men
        - Always seem to come from the South
        - Actively pursue the fleeing guards and may be taking prisoners
    - The attacks are always preceded by a harmless looking little old man asking for directions
- One of the clerics stationed in the palace turned out to be an enemy of the Count, and immediately cast [Flame Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flame-strike) in an attempt to kill either [[Jorlon]] or [[John Brunis]]
- In the confusion, the party was hit from behind with [Thunderwave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thunderwave), cast by [[Olahna Hanali]] - someone that up to that point had been a constant companion and party member for the previous 3 years
- After casting Thunderwave, [[Olahna]]’s appearance changed, several members of the party recognized her new form as one of a [[Doppelganger]], then used her helm of teleportation to beat a hasty exit.
- A gnome cleric ([[Tandaleia Deleamintaviglia]]), dressed in the colors of [[Eor]], rushed out to tend to the count’s wounds.
- The party was able to fell 1 of the rogue clerics, but the one that cast Flame Strike ( [[Mordrin]] )was able to escape.
- After the attack, the [[John Brunis|Count]] asked the party to hurry with their investigation, and seemed to want to impress extra urgency upon the group
- The gnome cleric, [[Tandaleia Deleamintaviglia]], joined the party
- The Party made haste for [[Newcombe]]. Along the way they met some more of the Count’s clerics heading back to [[Vendare]].
    - The clerics told the party:
        - They were coming from [[Waycombe]]
        - There is a rumor that the count’s soldiers were attacked and either killed or scattered by the brigands
        - There are some superstitious stories among the peasants…
            - horrible flying creatures that are coming in the night to carry people away.
            - some sinister power in [[The Great Southern Swamp]]
        - The clerics don’t believe these are anything more than the usual types of rumors spread when there’s trouble in an area.
        - More alarming to the clerics are vague stories of demon worship by some of the peasants
-   Continuing along the road, the party was attacked by Lizardfolk, who didn’t stand much of a chance against the might of a fireball, but seemed content to fight to the death even after seeing most of their brethren fall.
    -   One of these lizardfolk yelled something in draconic, and had a brief exchange with [[Goradaar Delmirev|Goradaar]]
