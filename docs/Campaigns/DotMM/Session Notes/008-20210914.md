- [[Tsakor]] went into the village of [[Waycombe]] where he spoke with the innkeep ([[Quinn Crewe]]) who mentioned that:
	- he was leaving like the rest of the villagers.
	- his son, William, was taken by the bandits and carted off to who knows where
 - [[Tsakor]] agreed that if the party were to find his son [[William Crewe]], that they would take him home. 
 - The party met and negotiated passage through the swamp aboard [[Stephen DeSantis]]' raft. 
	 - Stephen is a jolly soul, convinced his hair is made from snakes, and that [[Sakatha]] can help him get rid of them.
