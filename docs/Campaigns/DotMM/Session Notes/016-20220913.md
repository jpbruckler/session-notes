!!! info "Session Summary: 016-20220913"
    Accolades and good fortune are showered on the party for bringing down a scourge that had been a pox upon the lands for over 400 years. They also had a relatively easy time finding specific magic items that they were looking for… odd, that.
    
    A feast and a festival was thrown in their honor, and they were made barons and given 32k acres of land (roughly 50 square miles) in honor of their achievement.
