!!! info "Session Summary: 016-20220913"
    Accolades and good fortune are showered on the party for bringing down a scourge that had been a pox upon the lands for over 400 years. They also had a relatively easy time finding specific magic items that they were looking for… odd, that.
    
    A feast and a festival was thrown in their honor, and they were made barons and given 32k acres of land (roughly 50 square miles) in honor of their achievement.

## Barony of Aldwulf

50 square miles (32,000 acres)
Primary exports: wheat/grain, dairy

### History

During the [[Siege on Sakatha’s Stronghold ]] (1087 DR), [[Thorley Aldwulf]]  distinguished himself among the rest of the fighting force by finding and exploiting a weakness in the wall around [[Sakatha]]’s fortress in [[The Evermoors]]. Thorley led a small contingent of men on a scouting mission to try to find where [[Sakatha]]’s forces were bringing supplies in. During this scouting mission a partially submerged tunnel was spotted. Thorley and these men cleared the tunnel entrance, and were able to gain entrance to [[Sakatha]]’s stronghold. Thorley and his men opened up a gate, allowing the larger force led by [[Sigeweard Brunis]] to enter the compound. This single act directly led to the destruction of [[Sakatha]]. After [[Sakatha]] fell, Sigeweard was made a count. His first action as count was to make Thorley a baron in recognition of his contribution to freeing the land from the Lizard King’s evil grip.

For 17 generations the barony has passed to the eldest Aldwulf child in an unbroken line. The barony itself has some of the richest farmlands in the entire county. Aldwulf farmland produces 10% of all the wheat produced in the entire county. The farm also produces nearly 13% of the dairy for the county.

To this day the anniversary of the founding of the barony is observed on the 17th day of Kythorn (The Time of Flowers by the common people). Called Thorlesday, it starts a 4 day long festival that lasts through the Summer Solstice (20th of Kythorn).
