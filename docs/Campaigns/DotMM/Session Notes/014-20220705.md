You stand in a room whose sides you can't perceive - the floor is within view, but the edges of the room are obscured by complete darkness. Sitting on a primitive throne made from an amalgam of bones sits your prey - Sakatha. You've followed a trail of bandits, cultists, kidappings, lizardmen, and a dragon to get to this point. His hulking frame nearly dwarfs the throne he sits upon. His eyes are keen intelligence and stone-cold malice. 

!!! info
    I have slumbered for 200 years, and toiled these last few months to rebuild what was taken from me. These lands belong to me. The people that inhabit it place their loyalty in that fool of a Duke. He himself is a pale shadow of his elder that sent me to my slumber all those years ago. Your involvement whith him has slowed my plans, but has not stopped it. You are ultimately an inconvenience.
    
    You could instead be a help, should you accept my gift. I understand that one of your number have stabbed you in the back. With my gift you could easily take revenge.
    
    I do not hate those I feed upon. Just as you do not hate the crops you harvest or the livestock you slaughter. At times I have even given those pitiful villagers a gift. Perhaps, if you surrender now, I can show you this gift, and lift the burden of mortality from your weary shoulders.
    
    You would be my lieutenants, expanding the reach of my control, and in return your power will dwarf that of any other creature alive - other than myself, of course.
    
    Should you prefer to die slowly over the course of months while being deprived of your skin in turns, you need only lift a finger to attempt to oppose me. Doing so seals your fate. The choice is yours.


The showdown between [[The Legion of the Emerald Goat]] and [[Sakatha]] is here! [[Sakatha]] attempted to convince the party to join him as he regained the lands he ruled some 200 years before. The party was not to be persuaded â€” given the choice between death and playing 2nd fiddle to some vampiric Lizard, they decided that death ([[Sakatha]]'s, not theirs) was the more agreeable option.

During the fight, [[Gwenith Serena|Gwen]] was beguiled by [[Sakatha]]'s charm and grace, [[Tsakor]] hexed the heinous hooligan, delivering devastating damage to the savage serpent scoundrel. [[Tandaleia Deleamintaviglia|Maggie]] showed up with timely healing, dynamic divine power and powerful protection. [[Goradaar Delmirev|Goradaar]], though unable to facilitate a firey furnace of fireballs, still handed out hefty helpings of hurt through the arcane arts.

As [[Sakatha]] fell, he transformed into mist, and was about to head to his coffin to regenerate when time seemed to stop, or everyone was paralyzed or otherwise held in check through some magical force. A wild-looking old mage blinked into existence and with a wave of his staff the mist-that-was-Sakatha was no more.

The mage introduced himself as [[Halaster Blackcloak]], and acknowledged the party's prowess, inviting them to visit his abode beneath [[Waterdeep]], through the [[Yawning Portal]].

The party took a long rest. The date at the end of the session is the 8th day of the 12th month (Highharvestide).

Once Halaster left, the party rummaged and ransacked Sakatha's study, and was able to find the following:
