## Session Log


- Combat continued from last session.
- The party defeated most of the assailants. In the fight, the caster was put to sleep. The 4 veteran warriors and a [[displacer beast]] were killed. A second [[displacer beast]] was dragging the sleeping caster away with its tentacles for a tasty meal when the party noticed it.
- The party damaged the last beast and it left its meal, although the caster had died from the [[displacer beast]]'s munching.
- Having sustained damage and used spell slots on a battle that nearly dropped one of the party, [[Danger Inc.]]  decided to camp for the night. They did travel 1 hour further to put some distance between them and the escaped [[displacer beast]].
- The party found 120 gp, 25 sp, and a divine spell scroll of Dark Ball (see ice knife spell except necrotic instead of cold damage). His emblem, appearing to be similar to a holy symbol, was a crouching wolf. It looked similar to the alter found when the party exited the shrine…and encountered the 'floating armor.' See this passage from Session 39:

- The next day of travel was uneventful.
- The following day, shortly after noon, the party heard the sounds of combat over a small hill. Sneaking forward, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] saw the disturbing view of a battle between [[Aimesland]] [[Seina]] and an orc raiding party.
- While the formation of 7 remaining soldiers fought the 5 orcs still attacking them, another orc sadistically continued to pound on a soldier named [[Ikky Arrosand]]. A prone Ikky had lost his right hand already and did his best to ward off the orc's repeated bone-jarring blows. The formation could not hope to make it to their downed companion without sacrificing the group.
- The party all climbed into the wagon and raced over the crest and down the hill. [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] jumped from the passenger seat and dropped 2 orcs with her first 3 arrows. Soon only one soldier-damaged orc remained, but that didn't last long.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] was brutal, cutting off an orc head and throwing it at a comrade in an effort to intimidate. 
- [[Milfred|Sergeant Milfred]] and the [[dragonborn]] who formed the center of the soldiers' line, named [[Kanxaan]], approached [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] who had been fighting near them. [[Elinor]] also moved up to join the conversation.
- [[Milfred|Sergeant Milfred]] mentioned how lucky they were that the party had shown up. He explicitly thanked [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]], who had killed the orc mutilating Ikky.
- He then went about directing the troops. Burning the orcs. Tending to his wounded. Staging his dead, including his lieutenant. She had died in the battle.
- With a heavy heart, he told his remaining men and women "We shall mourn later. Now, we must ensure our wits are with us for the rest of the patrol.  Morning will be done within the walls of the fort."    
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] found 7 gp and 37 sp among the orcs. The soldiers did not interfere with the looting.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] jotted down the symbol of the orcs, which she didn't recognize (it wasn't a major clan or tribe).
- After spending a bit of time with the soldiers, the party prepared to leave. The sergeant said he didn't need any additional help, as they had already helped more than enough.
- As they left, he thanked them again and asked what the party is known as. [[Elinor]] said "[[Danger Inc.]] ."
- At the next evening while they were looking for a suitable campsite, [[Elinor]] was contacted by [[Averos]].
- [[Averos]] said over 3 messages: after many, many hours of research the only reference to the [[Passion Place]] was an area bandit lieutenant's letter written 15 years ago. According to the letter, it's Master is a very powerful entity; a [[Battle Mage]], a warrior spell caster. The letter references a password (opps, passphrase) to allow passage by the place's guards. Since the passphrase was widely distributed, it was never changed according to the letter. The #ttrpg/passphrase is 'I kneel with the Master.' That's all the pertinent information.
- [[Danger Inc.]]  stopped for the night.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 9 pm on Month 6/Day 6
