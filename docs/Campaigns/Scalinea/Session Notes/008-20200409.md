## Session Log


Quest: [[Search and Rescue - Powell]]

- Defeated the Dragonpriest after releasing it from a sarcophagus. Burned him in the sarcophagus.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] and [[Olseris]] recovered for the party 39 gp, 183 sp, an ornate ceremonial dagger (125 gp), two silver rings adorned with tiny silver dragons (15 gp each), and a silver amulet (15 gp). Also 4 spell scrolls with [[cleric]] spells on them. 
- Lounged for a while resting and relaxing as the party hadn’t been awake too long
- Took a long rest, experiencing a seemly realistic [[SumonHo Dreams|dream]]
- Quickly closed three doors to avoid battling more giant rats
- Encountered “Big Mama,” a giant tumored [[rat]] and a few minions
- Closed that door as well and rushed away while she tried to bust out. One minion had squeezed through a hole in the door.

**All of the party members gained a level.**
