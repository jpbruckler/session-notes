## Session Log

- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] moved up to the door to take a few quick shots at the door.
- The four Lesser [[Eternal Agent]] (aka [[Eternal Agent#^59d977|Eternal Agents, Lesser]]) attacked nearly as quickly. With [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] in the door and the EAL able to scale the walls with ease, she soon found herself surrounded.
- The other, standard if you will, kind of [[Eternal Agent#^3ccc5e|Eternal Agent, Standard]] bellowed a cloud of noxious gas that stung their eyes and burned their very skin. It was also so dense that visibility was reduced to zero.
- Only [[Hopeful]] and the wizard [[Argon]] were outside of its effect.
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] turned a few undead, even destroying one outright. But before they could actually run away the party whacked them.
- After a short but hard fight, nearly all of the undead lay destroyed on the stone floor.
- [[Danger Inc.]]  returned to the dwarven armory. Using a piton to hold the door and the Leomund's Hut spell for further protection, they rested for several hours.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 9 pm on Month 6/Day 26
