## Session Log

- [[Elinor]] cast Alter Self’s Aquatic Adaption to enter the room flooded nearly to the ceiling while the rest of the party stood guard.
- [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]]  rejoined the party.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] put on [[Tloques-Popolocas]]’s bracelets.
- The door was swelled shut, so [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] came to assist. When it opened, the room emptied taking [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], [[Elinor]], and [[Hopeful]] with it. All three were able to get a grip on a corner or doorway.
- The hallway led to another flooded room with a dark, foul water covering the floor.
- [[Gwyn Hovey]] fell into a deep spot unable to catch himself on the slippery floor. [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] jumped in to help him out since his heavy armor interfered with swimming. [[Elinor]] also assisted with a crowbar and rope provided by [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]].
- A monstrous, intelligent snail called the room its home. It tried to verbally engage the party but they couldn’t understand it. It ‘explored’ [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]’s shoulder with its mouth (it lacks hands or paws). They head butted each other a couple of times. (Interestingly, the snail was nearly twice as intelligent as [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]).
- When it couldn’t talk to them but they were spending time hanging out in its hall, it pushed [[Elinor]] who responded to the impact with a sharp, magic-imbued retort. Not waiting around to see how the exchange went, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] did what she does best…she lit the snail up with her bow.
- Amazingly, other than some trouble moving to the steps, the party didn’t have any trouble fighting on the very slippery floor.
- It spewed a large chunk of mucus at the group, hitting [[Elinor]], [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]] , and [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]. The water slowly rots their clothes, but this acidic phlegm burns the skin.
- The party had worn it down and it couldn’t communicate with them, so it tried to run. In melee with [[Gwyn Hovey]], [[Elinor]], and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], all three took the opportunity to land blows. It was cut down by the collective force.
- Leaving the hall, they found the secret tunnel again. [Ahem, I’ll refrain] Traversing it, they returned to the unexplored hallway. 
- The hallway ended at a door. A sound could be heard that may be singing or echoing water.
- Opening the door, [[Gwyn Hovey]] heard a shriek and a splash. Whatever it may have been, it was gone by the time the door opened. The room was half filled with water.
- Just about everything in the room shone like soft moonlight. But no creature could be seen in the clear water (although the gas still obscured vision).
- [[Gwyn Hovey]] and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] hurried up to the water, cautiously followed by the rest. [[Gwyn Hovey]] and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] discussed [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]’s treatment of [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]] .
- As the party collected on the shoreline, a swimmer in the water giggled. She also spoke the foreign language and had an alien beauty about her. 
- Largely ignoring her, the party followed the ledge [[Gwyn Hovey]] found around to the door.
- Another extremely slippery floor was traversed. The water from the previous room and this hallway was clean and potable. Waterskins were filled and Auntie rinsed her whole body and clothing. Others like [[Elinor]] rinsed their face.
- [[Danger Inc.]]  entered a Great Hall, well over 100 feet long and 20 feet wide. Frescos line the walls and a tunnel, or so it appeared, led out the other side beyond an archway. The south wall’s frescos were a depiction of a great battle. The north wall depicts the quest for a new land. Near the center shows a pyramid with a temple atop it. The sun shines brightly (figuratively) above the temple.
- As the party exited under the archway, [[Gwyn Hovey]] walked into a wall just beyond. The “continuing” hallway was actually a masterfully painted scene.
- As they searched for a way forward, a plate in the floor caused bars to drop from the archway, trapping [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] and [[Gwyn Hovey]] in the small room.
- The party went about searching…
    - [[Gwyn Hovey]] continued to search for a way out
    - [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] used his maul to see if he could break through the wall, causing much paint to collapse
    - [[Hopeful]] searched for a button or switch, to no avail
    - [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] looked around the broader room for anything they missed (Brandi, I think this was it)
    - [[Elinor]] checked out the paintings for clues or signs (Stephanie,I also not sure I remembered right)
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] and [[Elinor]] both realized the portion of the work that depicts a sun was separate from the rest of the wall and slightly inset. The sun is 8 to 10 feet off the floor.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 11:45 pm on Month 5/Day 26
