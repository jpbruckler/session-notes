## Log

Quest: [[Search and Rescue - Powell]]

- A guard told the group where to find [[Vivian Powell]]’s home and let them know he would also file a report about Shawyn’s body.
- After talking to a guard at the gate to the “walled community,” the party was escorted to the house.
- Vivian’s butler Alfredo let them in, helped cover the body at [[Olseris]]’s suggestion, and fetched the mistress. The party waited with the foyer guard.
- Vivian listened to the party, asked a few questions, told Alfredo to ensure the 100gp was delivered to the Rested Moose tomorrow, and thanked the party. She was attended by a [[Halfling]] maiden.
- The party shared their experience with [[Alex]] (senior Peacekeeper), [[Krisvyre]] (Constable), [[Aster]] (Assistant Constable on duty), and a [[Seina]] representative. They had reports of the Crimson column of light and would investigate that the next day. The [[Peacekeepers]] would take the lead on the disturbance due to distance from [[Fowlerville]] and coordinate Sienna support. They also noted, for military purposes, the infestation of [[Fortress Down Under|the Fortress Down Under]] and the existence of the [[white dragon wyrmling]].

Below are the highlights of four days of #ttrpg/downtime:

- [[Elinor]]:
    - Spent 2 days training with a qualified fighter on weapon use
    - had an explosive rune blow up in her face
    - read the dragon-scale bound book on dragon lore and sold it for what she could get around here to avoid carrying it around. 

- [[Eljas]]: 
    - Went on the shopping trip with the group
    - Spent a day helping to train (and learning from other trainers) junior sienna soldiers in medicine and arms
    - spent a day in intense practice bettering himself
    - and had a dream (it said it brought his consciousness to it) near an alter with a symbol similar to the one stowed that flashed them.
    - The voice said he could cast the cantrip resistance as in the dream but questioned if he had “declined the help.”  

- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]: 
    - Participated in 4 days of training with [[Alledon]], a qualified Ranger and ate well.

- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]: 
    - Went on the shopping trip with the group
    - Spent 2 days training with an expert barbarian beserker
    - realized that he could cast [[Spells T#True Strike]] cantrip.

- [[Olseris]]: 
    - Went on the shopping trip with the group
    - Spent time relating with and building relationships with Sienna soldiers
    - Spent 1 day training with a qualified fighter who worked with polearms
    - spent 2 days improving himself in meditation, forms (kata), and inspired by his weapon/patron
    - ealized that he could cast [[Spells G#Green Flame Blade]] cantrip.

- [[Bronson]]
    - Day 1- EK Weapon Bonded with [[Sharwyn Powell|Sharwyn]]’s dagger over a short rest; Cast Find Familiar to summon Cassiel, who took the form of a [[Hawk]]; and, being a hired trainer for the guard with knowledge of where the scout party were going, he participated with Sienna in scouting the Crimson Column. Findings included a weird maroon stone embedded in the ground, eleven blackish spots on the ground to one side of the stone in an area about the 10-20 feet away, found a group of 3 burned wagons about half a mile away, found part of a letter from the wagon fires, and a short pitched battle with some ghouls.
    - Day 2- Arranged training for day 3; purchased a component pouch (gift for [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]) and found someone he could purchase another set of Thieves’ Tools from so [[Elinor]] can keep one; exchanged some coin for gems for ease of carry; bought incense and herbs sufficient for 5 more castings of find familiar; and purchased 2 scores of quality arrows from [[Grux]] (much higher quality but no game mechanic benefit), one to carry and one kept on [[Bronson#Judgment]] (his [[warhorse]]).
    - Day 3-Trained with a qualified fighter.
    - Day 4-Light practice he enjoyed, rested, and rejuvenated in his room and just outside of town.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 7 am on Month 3/Day 29
