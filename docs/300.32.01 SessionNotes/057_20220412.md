## Log

- [[Danger Inc.]]  pushed their way into the old reserve barracks to do battle with 7 undead. Using his faith to channel the power of his deity, [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] immediately destroyed all three skeletons and drove fear into the [[Eternal Agent]]. Soon afterward all the undead were lifeless.
- While passing into the vault challenge room, [[Argon]] picked up a magic battle ax off the [[Eternal Agent]] and [[Elinor]] picked up a Necklace of Prayer Beads From [[Strolbreln Tower]] off a skeleton.
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] led them past the bars that separated the room and had just enough skill to pick the lock on the inner vault door.
- The vault had marvelous wealth within. Chests and sacks of gold sat on the ground and tables. Sticking out of the coins were various items; rods, boots, bracers, and arrows. A beautiful set of splint armor sat a few feet from a gleaming breastplate. On the large table beside a chest and a sack, a brazier full of gems glisten in any light near them.   
- As the party tried to make the tough decision of which 3 magic items to take, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] clarified with [[Nabrim the Terrific|Nabrim]] the Terrific that the party could take a total of 3 items, not 3 each. These three items were in addition to the maroon [[Penetration Stone|Stone of Power]].
- After much deliberation and moving the wealth from the inner vault to the bathing room, they left with the Scepter of Eternal Winter, Bracers of Shadow Boxing, and Gauntlets of Ogre Power. With the [[Penetration Stone|Penetration Stone]] tucked snuggly in [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]'s bag of holding, the party left behind the immovable rod and other precious items.
- As the party reached the bridge to leave, [[Nabrim the Terrific|Nabrim]] the Terrific asked them how many items they had taken from the vault. He watched each of them intently as they stated they only had the offered three items. Satisfied, the party left unmolested.
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] tried to persuade the being that the Unmovable Rod was ugly and may be unwanted by [[Nabrim the Terrific|Nabrim]]. *When [[Nabrim the Terrific|Nabrim]] the Terrific said he may be willing to trade the rod, he declined the offered Auntie Summoning Solution. However, he did trade another random potion for it. The potion turned out to be a potion of acid resistance. 
- [[Nabrim the Terrific|Nabrim]] the Terrific didn't have an idea for them to escape the basement without going through the above ground portion of the watch tower. The river through the [[Reserve Hall]] had a barrier farther down so that way would not work.
- As the party worked their way back through the safe/vault and the other sealed rooms, they remembered an unexplored area hidden behind a wall.
- [[Danger Inc.]]  found an escape tunnel that led 2 miles away from the [[Strolbreln Tower]]; raising elevation but with many rises and dips. 
- [[Danger Inc.]]  exited the escape tunnel…the SECRET TUNNEL… on a steep slope among numerous scrubby bushes. Working their way down goat paths and dried up watersheds, they worked their way down the trail. The brush was often sparse but also thick at times. After 45 minutes of hard work and sometimes treacherous footing, the group found a level place with sufficient cover to hide them but enough room to be comfortable. There, they began their rest until morning.      
- The party members achieved 7th Level.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 2:30 am on Month 6/Day 23
