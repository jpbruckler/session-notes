## Log

- The party set out from the [[Chillin Tower]]  for the [[Passion Place]].
- After about a mile from the tower, the notes of song birds once again serenaded the party.
- Along the way, the sharp eyes of [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] spied a couple hobgoblins walk past further down the path across a clearing. The third one spotted the party. Little was visible other than its head due to the foliage. As it took its bow off its back, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] killed it.
- A 'large' deep voice said "what was that."
- Another face appeared and [[Elinor]]'s readied Eldritch Blast killed it. A third appeared, but it decided to forego battle in order to run.
- Two distinct voices in the clearing argued a bit, one razzing the other about being scared of little humanoids.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] snuck forward to get a look, then headed back by the party to hide. He saw a pair of 15' tall muscled creatures with clubs and sacks near a huge tree.
- They came to the head of the trail and said, "Hey, what are you guys doing back there." [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] yelled that he was looking for his holy symbol he had lost. The rest of the party were in a position to suddenly attack the huge creatures if necessary.
- After a brief exchange following their question "do you taste good," it was determined that they didn't want anything to do with the Necromancer ([[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] mentioned a juicy wizard), the trolls taste terrible, [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]]'s god requires him to eat trolls, [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] probably tastes terrible too, and [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] thought the hobgoblins looked tasty. The giants went to see if they could find the hobgoblins.
- After another hour of travel, the group came to a rope bridge over a wide (30') not-too-deep but fast moving river. [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] worked her way down to the bank. After almost falling in the first few steps, she headed back up the bank.
- Using her Ring of Jumping, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] jumped across the river, collected the end of the bridge, then jumped back across.
- Using the Mending gift from Hun Hoksa, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] fixed the bridge on the cut ends. It was then good as new.
- [[Danger Inc.]]  reached the location [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]]  said was the [[Passion Place]].
- As the trail leads through the tall grass, it enters a wide woods. A few miles later, you reach the edge of the trees. Before you is a 60' high cliff. There is 200 feet of open space between you and a cave entrance. Some of the trees have been recently cut down and processed into firewood. At the entrance, you can see a nearly-square door a dozen feet wide. You can see the edge of a portcullis hanging down at the top. Two creatures lounge near the door. An ogre is sitting against the wall, tossing up a rock and catching it. Nearby, a giant animal basks in the sun; possibly a rat or a badger. In the distance, seven hobgoblins practice battle techniques as they perform tactical movements.  
- [[Danger Inc.]]  strolled in. Using the pass phrase, the ogre stood aside. He didn't follow them into the tunnel, although the party noted that he watched them from the other end.
- You pass under the portcullis dipping from the bright daylight into darkness. As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you're looking down a long hallway at least 50' long. There are four doors on each side. Along the hall in several places, there are blast marks that appear to have been caused by immense heat. They are sporadic along the hall with no clear source. As you move down the hallway you can see a large fire far ahead of you. There is a large shape in front of it, but it is well over 100' away and impossible to make out.
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] didn't find any traps or a source for the blast marks. They didn't seem to follow a pattern, so she suspected the blast marks were not part of a trap.
- A raised portcullis is at this end of the hallway as well. The hall it reveals is huge; almost 200' deep and probably 70' wide. Although cut from the rock, it is roughly a rectangle. As you enter the room, a strange corrupted smell hangs in the air. On both sides of the doorway, a badly burnt corpse stands unmoving. In the center of the room, a seat that would best be described as a rudimentary low-backed throne sits empty. Twenty feet behind it is a large fire in a pit. A 6' tall humanoid stands before the seat. His heavily muscled body is covered in skin the color of soot. His pants around his waist stop at the top of his calves and match the blackish blue color of his cloak. His bare chest shows the dark leather strap of his scabbard. His left hand rests on a large dog with jet black fur and glowing red eyes.
- The doorway you enter through allows 25' of floor before reaching a moat of viscous liquid. Three wooden bridges lie across its 5' span. A table set with bread and crackers sits against the wall far to your right. With the plates and bowls present, you imagine that fruits and meats may be added in time. Between the central chair and the entrance, there are four large squares painted on the floor; 10' by 20', 15' by 20', 20' by 20', and 30' by 30'. They look similar to fighting rings. The smallest of them has an unconscious dwarf sprawled face down. Three dummies and four targets are just to your left, allowing bow practice at distances from 30' to 200'.
- Hanging from the 30 foot ceiling are chains. Many of them at symmetrical intervals have metal containers with flames lipping up. These provide at least dim light throughout the entire room, augmented by the bon fire. Several chains instead hold up metal cages of a design that you would expect to hold a huge bird. The cages vary from 10 to 20 feet off the ground. All but one appear empty. In the back, a robed and hooded creature is slumped on the cage floor. At a distance of 150' from the door, you can make out no other details.
- Against the back wall, a green scaled dragon-like creature beats its wings while it's two legs grip a fence making up a large pen. A half-orc and two orcs watch laughing as a flustered human seems to be looking at the soot-colored humanoid in front of the throne, while gesturing at the beast. The beast must have growled or something else unheard at this distance, for the human quickly backed away from it with his hands up defensively. His three orcish companions broke out laughing hysterically.
- The back left corner is a 10' by 20' caged area with bars that look like a jail. However, the area appears to be for storage of stuff rather than prisoners.
- Against the left wall, a large table sits with a pair of elves, ebony in color, playing some form of cards; One male, one female. The firelight from the large fire flickers off their chain shirts. Another shirtless barrel-chested creature watches over them. His human torso and head are connected to the body of a lion. His chest was only covered by the strap of a quiver of arrows, that and the longbow.
- Turning facing you, the soot-colored man grabs a two-handed sword that was leaning against the back of the throne and slides it into his scabbard. Both the powerful soot-colored man and the human/lion [[chimera]] begin to move toward you. The man from the throne holds up a hand at the [[chimera]] and says, "I've got the interlopers. You can stay with them." At that he strides across the room toward you. The [[chimera]] returns to the elves, but doesn't fully pull his attention away from you. As he gets closer, you can make out the piercing eyes with pupils the color of rubies. [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]]  whispers in an excited voice "This is your chance. It's time to act."
- The characters were exchanging quick whispers as he approached. Even [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] considered this group a no win battle. [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]]  "assured" them that if they took down the Master, the other creatures wouldn't help him. She insists, 'they were only here out of fear.'
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] asked [[Auntie Caustic|Caus]]  where her brother was. She said a bit exasperated 'I don't know. I know he came here but I don't know what happened to him.' She again implored, "We have to act now, we cannot hesitate." 'We can't give him time.'
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] stepped up to the microphone again. He parlayed, 'Who's butt do I have to kick to kneel with the Master.' The soot-colored man said, "I guess that would be me." There was a brief exchange where the soot-colored man said, 'I am the Master.' [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] dug into the inconsistency he heard retorting, 'Now you say you're the Master. Earlier when I asked who I needed to beat to see the Master you said it was you. Well, which is it."
- At that point, the Master began to make an aggressive move that called for initiative. 

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 3 pm on Month 6/Day 25
