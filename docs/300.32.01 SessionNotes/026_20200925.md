## Log


- [[Danger Inc.]] , [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]], [[Freddie]], and the 2 villagers headed back to [[Blessingburg]]. Arriving just before sun up, they went to bed with the plan to leave for the [[Dancing Drake]] in the morning.
- Eating together at 2 pm, [[Freddie]] would travel with the party to [[Aimesville]] by way of the [[Dancing Drake]]. After learning what he can about the [[Penetration Stone|penetration stone]] in [[Aimesville]], he will head back to the sanctuary of [[Hun-Hoksa]].
- The first partial day of travel was uneventful, but they encountered 2 elk carcasses infested with giant centipedes.
- Arriving at the [[Dancing Drake]], the party ate before meeting [[Averos]]. In exchange for retrieving the [[Necomancers Bane]] from [[Khandrukar]], the four surviving members of [[Danger Inc.]]  received 3,000 gp worth of coins and gems. All four party members got 728 gp worth.
- Due to having many loose ends they still have to follow-up on and the loss of close friends, [[Danger Inc.]]  will not take another mission right now. [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] told [[Averos]] he could check in on them in a month.
- [[Averos]] gave [[Bronson]] information he believes relates to [[Knight Akleman]]. [[Bronson]]decided to go with the party to [[Aimesville]], but he will need to head to [[Honorville]] to look into [[Islam Akleman]]. Islam’s son was hung by [[Lord Townsend]] for banditry.
- The party would get an early start in the morning which should allow them to arrive in [[Aimesville]] in 3 long days of travel. A platoon of soldiers with a caravan shortly behind it would be safer but take too long to arrive.
- About 5 miles outside of town, [[Elinor]] used her disguise kit and [[Disciple Antwon]]’s clothes/armor to appear as him. At opportune times, she also used the Disguise Self spell. The group will meet in the [[Home Comfort Inn]].
- [[Elinor]] expects [[Laidor]] to be in the [[Fizzy Naval Bar and Tavern]] for dinner tomorrow night. He is usually there 2 days a week.
- With amazing insight, [[Elinor]] found a waiter that seemed to recognize her. He referred to her as “Brother.” Although confused why she was asking, he said the next meeting was in three days behind the [[Dirty Kitten]]. He showed her some deferential treatment and also reminded her not to forget her “card.” ([[Brotherhood ID Card]])
- [[Elinor]] and [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] returned to the restaurant and followed him to a one room home on the poor side of town. It looked like multiple people lived there. They plan to enter his home when he goes to work the next day.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] is looking for a bar fight. We’ll see how that turns out next week.  
- [[Bronson]], [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]], and [[Freddie]] found the [[Everson Estate]] in the upper middle-class neighborhood, large but old. The guard seemed to close down his post at 1 am.
