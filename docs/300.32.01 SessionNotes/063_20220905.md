## Session Log

[[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] continues to be legendarily bad at hitting things.

Killed one of the umber hulks, the other ran away.

We continue on, [[Elinor]] noticed an oncoming Duergar patrol, the party hides, and the patrol passes.

Don explains that having the light isn't the disadvantage we think it will be, as people that can see would have to take in all the sights, and a point of light to someone that sees nothing else, would stand out more.

We eventually come to a Friedenblast, it's fissure-y and shiny mushroomy. We come across some fungus called "Ripple bark", according to [[Dranaste]], which despite it's appearance is quite tasty.

We take a long rest after [[Dranaste]] procures a guide.

In the morning, we make our way to the gazebo - and meet Fumberg "the flyer" and Fred "the natural" - web surfers. Fred wears his helmet all the time, Fumberg only wears it while web surfing.

We do manage to make our way across the webs criss-crossing the fissure. Fred throws a rather large bug and some food over the side and down to the spiders below. 

Fumberg talks about the dangers of the bridge, ad nauseum. During his lesson on the dangers of the web, the party is attacked by some kind of squid-like thing flies down at us and attacks, landing on heads, [[Dranaste]] and Kerishi are hit by these creatures, called Darkmantles. While hit, the mantles cover the head of the hit creature, preventing them from breathing or seeing.

[[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] removed the darkmantle from [[Dranaste]] with a mighty heave, then casts Spiritual Weapon, scoring a critical hit and destroying the darkmantle.

We take out the Darkmantles and make our way across the fissure, with no more incidents.
