## Log

Quest: [[SLD - Retrieve Necromancers Bane]]

- The morning began with a temporary exchange with a boisterous [[Dragonborn]] in splint mail and a [[human]] in her studded leather. The exchange was an apple for a handaxe, although it began with a fork. AKA, [[Eljas]] is a hothead.
- [[Bronson]] collected his [[warhorse]] from the stables. He also collected the wagon and 2 draft horses [[Eljas]]/[[Olseris]] purchased.
- The party set off on a 6 day trip (long days) to the [[Dancing Drake]].
- [[Bronson]] introduced the party to his familiar [[Bronson#Cassiel]], or “Cass.” Cassiel is in the form of a [[hawk]], a very common bird in this area.
- The first night when setting up camp, the party was attacked by three weird, hairless, maroon-skinned undead who moved like quick monkeys and a pair of shadows. The maroon undead’s bite drained strength much like the shadows touch does. Cassiel was killed by one of them, as it climbed effortlessly.
- [[Bronson]] summoned Cassiel in [[hawk]] form again before going to bed using incense and herbs.
- The next day was uneventful, other than the anxiousness of a bad storm that stayed south of the road.
- On mid-morning of the third day, the party encountered 8 nearly-giant wasps. The party defeated them, which will be good for any less-capable travelers that may have come across them. Despite the [[Dragonborn]]’s disparaging jeer at [[Eljas]], the ladies of this party demonstrated how well women can fight. The battle started with [[Elinor]]’s bold use of the thunderwave spell and it ended with [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]’s precision arrow shot.
- Do they search for the nest or get going while getting is good? 

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 11 am on Month 4/Day 01
