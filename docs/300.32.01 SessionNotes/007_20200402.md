# 007_20200402

 > [!tldr] [[007_20200402]]
 > The party learns about capitalism. We didn't do the job as agreed upon, so we didn't get the pay. Nonplussed, the party continues deeper into the fortress, braving traps and gross cobwebs. [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula's]] small size and quick wits allow the party to bypass a pit trap. The next room contained a sarcophogas, and inside was a Troll Priest. Roll initiative!

## Log
Quest: [[Search and Rescue - Powell]]

- [[Grenl]] climbed down into the shaft to retrieve the signet ring from the missing body of [[Durnn]]
- Although the trap was able to be disabled, the lock was too difficult for [[Bronson]] or [[Elinor]] to pick
- The party took a [[Adventuring#^e21bdf|short rest]]
- [[Grenl]] returned with the signet ring. [[Bronson]] surmised that she also grabbed the key to the chest. She turned over both to the party.
- The chest contained 231 gp and 2 onyx gems. The party ([[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]) also found a pair of silver moonstone earrings and a matching moonstone necklace that is believed to be Sharwyn Powell’s jewelry. They also recovered 4 longbows and 4 long swords
- The party told [[Grenl]] to let the [[goblin]] warriors know that they had a truce, but also said they would leave them alone
- They were stopped and brought to [[Yusdrayl|Yusdrayl]] to report. They reported that they killed the hobgoblins and the goblins were ‘under the influence’ of [[Belak|the Outcast]]. So the party was not going to kill them anymore. [[Yusdrayl|Yusdrayl]] agreed they could stop but did not offer the agreed upon reward for a completed job
- The group seems to have decided to head back without taking the short-cut through the kobold area. No one is comfortable with leaving the daughter below or possibly even letting [[Belak|the Outcast]] continue to operate unchallenged
- The party opened the door with the magic lock using the key awarded for returning the dragon. Is the door opened, a hissing noise and a puff of dust expelled. The rooms’ floors were covered in ageless dust
- A dimly lit globe in the southern alcove of the first room made music of tinkling notes. Upon [[Elinor]] and Elijas coming close, it turned brooding and made [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] run away. [[Eljas]] and [[Bronson]] went to check on them, while [[Olseris]] and [[Elinor]] dealt with how to proceed. Ultimately, they ended up destroying the globe
- After reconvening, the party moved through the next corridor (springing an arrow trap) into a hall with a marble dragon statue
- Upon approaching, the statue asked a riddle. [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] announced the correct response from over by the door, opening a secret door in the other wall
- The next hall had 6 alcoves along its north and south walls (3 each) with 5 eleven statues. The far end of the room contained a pit with spikes. A sarcophagus was in the next hall. [[Elinor]] found small feet prints in the empty alcove. [[Bronson]] found a secret door in the alcove next to it
- Before trying to figure out how to get out of the pit without injury, the party checked out the secret door to see if they could bypass the pit
- They found an alter covered with a canvas. The entire party either entered the room voluntarily or felt compelled to enter ([[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], [[Elinor]], and [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]). [[Olseris]] was inspired to touch the alter. Everyone was hit with a magical energy that “penetrates” them and “burns them to the core."
- [[Eljas]] found a secret trap door that led to the next room, bypassing the pit
- The party decided to take on the Dragonpriest believed to be held in the sarcophagus.  
- Upon unlatching it and pushing the lid off, a [[troll]] in rotted finery had its beady black eyes flash open and it snarled.  

Initiative order: 

1. [[Elinor]]
2. Dragonpriest
3. [[Bronson]]
4. [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]
5. [[Eljas]]
6. [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]
7. [[Olseris]]
