## Recap

## Log

- [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] checked out the [[hobgoblin captain]]'s room. He found some papers including a roster written in goblin. [[Elinor]], with the aid of a Comprehend Language spell, found that there were 15 hobgoblins assigned to the captain/commander of the tower.
- [[Danger Inc.]]  began to move toward two of the three doors on the right side of the hall. [[Elinor]] waited to make sure that [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] didn't need help.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] found a well hidden, wire-thin trap on the door. With great skill she was able to disable the trap so it couldn't hurt anyone. While [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] appreciated [[Elinor]]'s mentoring, it was clear to her that the student had become the master.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] walked into the kitchen. Inside were two goblins cooking and a hobgoblin in studded leather eating. The hobgoblin jailor was not even slightly intimidated by [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]'s best efforts. This infuriated her and she devastated the hobgoblin with a frenzied attack and a forced zap of [[Soulstriker|Soul Striker]].
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] acquired the party's first retainers for the [[Chillin Tower]] ; namely the goblin cooks. If they are still there when the party returns this way, they are hired. If reinforcements arrive at [[Strolbreln Tower]] first, they "never saw us." At 3 sp a week, they were excited by the job opportunity. So much so that one offered to carry [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]]'s sword. For that wage, they would even touch fresh food; the sacrifices people will make for a coin.
- The goblins made [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] a sandwich. They didn't know of a dwarven vault or safe, so they assume it is behind the "evil door." While the party explores, they are making sandwiches for everyone. But if reinforcements show up from the city, they will be giving the sandwiches to the hobgoblins.
- [[Elinor]] found food stuff in the other room. They were not fresh, but were edible.
- [[Hopeful]] snuck up on a human locked in the jail, then backed away. [[Elinor]] and [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] went to parley with the prisoner.
- His name is [[Argon]] and his party "didn't make it" when he was captured. The hobgoblins took his spellbook to the hobgoblin city, probably along with the rest of his equipment.
- [[Argon]] said in the [[Confederation of Independent City-States|CIC]] ([[Confederation of Independent City-States]], or just [[Confederation of Independent City-States|Confederation]]), a group of cultists had been causing trouble including arson and other harassment. [[Argon]]'s group was hired to investigate rumors the [[Cult of Indimordor]] originated from this area. The cult is dedicated to [[Indimordor]], a powerful demon.
- [[Argon]] cast Misty Step to get out of the cell. He started getting heavy armor (Chain Mail), shield, and long sword off of the fallen hobgoblins. [[Elinor]] used the key from the jailor's radiated body to unlock his irons. Later, the DM cheated and let him cast Bless on the party…he didn't have the material components needed for that spell. He implied (or maybe stated) that he didn't leave earlier because without his spellbook or night watch he didn't know how he could make the trek back to civilization.
- There isn't really any trust between the party and [[Argon]] yet, so the party is keeping him close. He is willing to go further into the tower for his share of the treasure recovered. [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] said he would get "a share" of the treasure, in keeping with his ability to contribute. [[Elinor]] said that he better not betray the party or he will get nothing. [[Argon]] said the party better not betray him or they'll get something. None of the maneuvering seemed overly aggressive or incite-ful.
- The "evil door" was next.
    - Before you stand a set of double doors. A chain with a padlock passes through the handles preventing further advance. These long standing doors have words in common written on them in aged and peeling paint. The words include "Stay Out" and "Keep Locked". Additionally, a sign with neatly stenciled words in goblin says "By the word of the Tower Commander, do not unlock or open this door. Death awaits beyond."
    - In addition to the padlock, the doors are boarded. It appears that there was once a board roughly tacked between the doors. Based on the age of the nail holes, it was removed long ago. But in its place is a board attached to the top of the doors and the wall above the doorway. Similarly a board is spiked to the floor that would also inhibit the doors from swinging open.
- [[Elinor]] picked the lock. While the boards were pried out, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] rushed to check out the last unexplored hall on this side of the 'evil door.' It was an armory where she refilled her quiver and brought [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] a mace named [[Firefly]]. She also found 100 gp, 150 sp, and 100 cp that she put in her pockets with her other valuables…namely her pancakes and syrup she is saving for later.
- Bringing it back to the party, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] directed her toward [[Elinor]]. With the bearing of an expert deceiver, [[Elinor]] took the coins showing nothing but gratitude…that is she took them AFTER she cast Prestidigitation to clean them.
- Seeing the hall behind the double doors, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]'s arrows bit into the zombies found there. [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]]'s Destroy Undead power made quick work of most of them.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] rushed down a side hall toward a commotion with caution to the wind. She found herself surrounded by a strange undead that has been seen in and around [[Penetration Stone|penetration stone]] [[Binding Site|Binding Sites]].

>"Much different than the zombies, these run on all fours like a chimpanzee. There maroon skin and pitch black hair make it hard to follow in the low light. They are quick and stare at you with a deadly hunger far more unnerving than even the simple horror of the walking dead."

(See [[Eternal Agent]])

- While she is hard to hurt and tough, the odds quickly moved against her so far from the party and fighting three nasty's at once. Between [[Elinor]]'s bravery, [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]'s magic, and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]'s tenacity, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] survived the encounter albeit with some of her strength sapped. Between her strength drained and the exhaustion of her battle frenzy, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] looks weary. Unfortunately, the assumption is that a rest to recover all of their energies would ensure [[Kondraroc]] would be made aware of their presence in the tower. The unblocked "evil doors" would point the way to the party.     

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 11 am on Month 6/Day 26
