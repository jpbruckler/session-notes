Dark Elf

Dark skin, white hair. Dressed in blacks and greys. Doesn't appear to be wearing any armor at first glance, but wears armor under his clothes. His armaments are light, consisting of daggers and a bow. He also carries a shield.

He has 2 hats, the first he got from his sister. The 2nd is a hat like a mosquito net, which helps (thought not mechanically) with the sunlight sensitivity.

[[Aleashia]] is his sister
