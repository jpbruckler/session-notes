# Eternal One

## Notes

From [[Perilous Realms]]:
- The book referenced a land deep in the [[Northern Frontier]] called [[Nowhere]]. While the [[Northern Frontier]] is treacherous with thick jungles spotted with steamy marshes and frigid mountain ranges stretching into the clouds, [[Nowhere]] is razed for miles. Here, the remains of the Eternal One are said to lie. His tower and tomb are at its center. A stahnk with its many horns protruding from its rotting flesh haunts the area and destroys anything to enter this realm. Its rampaging has destroyed anything living within several miles of the tower. Even vegetation has not survived its destruction. Due to the existence of this beast, even Llastoray the author didn’t dare come any closer.
