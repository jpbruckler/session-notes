## Description

An extremely old red dragon, Ashardalon had an appearance that diverged somewhat from usual ancient dragons of his kind. He possessed unusual demonic features and a scar on his chest in the shape of an enormous winged humanoid.

## Personality

Ashardalon was regarded as a self-important dragon with an almost desperate attachment to his own life. He was willing to go through whatever means necessary to prevent his own death.

_Ashardalon taking flight._

After suffering a mortal wound, Ashardalon attempted to extend his life by binding a balor called Ammet to his chest in order to function as a second heart. However, his injuries were too extensive for the balor's power to keep Ashardalon alive. He then moved to a domain in the Astral Plane known as the Bastion of Unborn Souls and established his lair there. He was kept alive thanks to the timeless nature of the Astral Plane and the unusual flow of energy that permeated the Bastion.

## Rumors & Legends

Ashardalon was rumored to be associated with a stronghold of the Cult of the Dragon located northwest of Thundertree]. The structure collapsed in the event of the eruption of Mount Hotenow in 1451 DR. Since then this stronghold was known as the Sunless Citadel, a structure that, like the dragon Ashardalon himself, had echoes across multiple worlds across the Material Plane.
