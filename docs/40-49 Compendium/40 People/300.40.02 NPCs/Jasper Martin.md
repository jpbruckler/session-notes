# Jasper Martin

## Notes
An experienced fighter and a magic user with an affinity to elemental fire, Jasper combined his disciplines to create a [[Battle Mage]] curriculum. He trained his disciples and founded the [[Battle Mage Assembly]]. Jasper is often called a hero of the people although there are plenty of references to people not particularly liking him. If the accounts in the library are to be believed, one person who didn't like Jasper was [[Julo Aimes]] (founder of [[Aimesland]]). He is known to live in the [[Ravaged Lands]], being seen occasionally but not as frequently as in decades past. While he appears human, descriptions of him don't seem to age much.

Incredibly beloved by [[Olgann]]
