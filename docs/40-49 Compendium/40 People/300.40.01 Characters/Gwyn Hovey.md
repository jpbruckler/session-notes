# Gwyn Hovey

## Notes

1. Starting the day:
    - **Channel Divinity: Twilight Sanctuary**
        - As an action, you present your holy symbol, and a sphere of twilight emanates from you. The sphere is centered on you, has a 30-foot radius, and is filled with dim light. The sphere moves with you, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die. Whenever a creature (including you) ends its turn in the sphere, you can grant that creature one of these benefits:
            - You grant it temporary hit points equal to 1d6 plus your cleric level.
            - You end one effect on it causing it to be charmed or frightened.
    - **Aid**
        - Your spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target's hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.
          **At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, a target's hit points increase by an additional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.
2. Battle
    - Round 1: Channel Divinity: Twilight Sanctuary, Spiritual Weapon
    - Round 2: Spirit Guardians, Spritual Weapon
3. After Battle:
    - **Aura of Vitaility**
        - Healing energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. You can use a bonus action to cause one creature in the aura (including you) to regain 2d6 hit points.
          **Note:** Outside of battle, this is **20d6** HP restored
