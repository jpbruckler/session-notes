## Background

We met Elinor on our way to our first delve into the [[Fortress Down Under]]. When we found her she was handcuffed and looked like she'd been roughing it for a while. She came with us to the Fortress - I guess she figured it was safer there than being out in the road waiting for whatever was chasing her.
