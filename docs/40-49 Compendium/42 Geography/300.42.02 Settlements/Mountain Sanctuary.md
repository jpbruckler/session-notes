## Description

The lair of [[Hun-Hoksa]] and her followers is called the Mountain Sanctuary.

[[Hun-Hoksa]] is a capable and important force for good. It feels good serving her. She cares for the residents of the Mountain Sanctum and all here care for her. She stays in the clouds above the Sanctum, but the Sanctum is considered her home. She is present about 2/3 of the time, the rest spent on other planes. While everyone here serves [[Hun-Hoksa]], [[Lana]] (the Physic Superior) manages the day-to-day activities of the residents. It is uncertain how much communication and direction happens between [[Hun-Hoksa]] and the Physic Superior, but no one has ever doubted that they are serving [[Hun-Hoksa]] and her will.

[[Hun-Hoksa]] in her true form appears as a large horse with a golden-brown scales. They are so fine they would probably go unnoticed at a greater distance. She has a long mane from the top of her head to the base of her neck of light brown, violet, and light green hair. Her beard and flowing tail are the same. A single horn protrudes from her skull. Her powerful body is impressive and she has piercing, intelligent eyes. She sometimes appears as a less intimidating common horse of a tanish-orange color with a white mane streaked with pink highlights,

Most days involve waking, the collective “morning routine” (breathing exercises, physical exercise/kata, meditation, news/assignments, and breakfast), followed by the work needed done for the day. It is most common for Faithe and [[Hopeful]] to volunteer to take ‘door guard’ during the morning routine as the martial aspects of Mountain Sanctum life has never really resonated with them. [[Hun-Hoksa]], when present, casts Create Food and Water as part of the morning routine. So breakfast is usually bland. Food preparation for the other meals adds flavor.

While there is a set lunch, it is not obligatory. Oftentimes work and day travel prevents attendance, but no one is required to eat as a group. However, most do.

Unless work assignments are overnight, everyone is expected to return for the collective “evening routine” (stretching and light exercise, news, dinner). Some day trips, that aren’t worth returning the next day to finish, may cause someone to miss the evening routine. If someone doesn’t make it back by the end of dinner, [[Faithe]] (the cleric of [[Untamo]]) uses the Sending spell to ensure they are safe. [[Hun-Hoksa]] is also able to cast Sending.

Work details are wide ranging. They range from maintaining the trail, dealing with intruders and sport hunters, food preparation, tending the small garden, and occasionally hunting. Longer term assignments can include searching for particular information or objects, assisting allies, or interfering with evil. “Interfering with evil” rarely happens more than 50 miles from the Mountain Sanctum.
