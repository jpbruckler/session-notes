## Description

The [[Aimesland]] Rauha are a specialized force who fills a role of investigating crime and dealing with advanced threats to [[Aimesland]] and its culture. They can generally be recognized by a dark blue cloak and wear a badge with an emblem of a green star in a tan circle. 

There are 2 ranks within the Rauha, Major and Minor. For Rauha Major, the star is a darker green.

The Rauha fill their ranks from [[Peacekeepers]],Â [[Seina]], or independently recruited persons; they are highly skilled and trusted government representatives. 

There are 12 Rauha Majors and they generally support [[Peacekeepers]]' operations throughout [[Aimesland]]. Rauha Minor investigate crimes. Due to their standing, infractions by Rauha, especially Rauha Major, are dealt with especially decisively.
