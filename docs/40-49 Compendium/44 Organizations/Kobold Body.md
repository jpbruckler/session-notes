## Description

During the [[Search and Rescue - Powell]] quest in [[Fortress Down Under|The Fortress Down Under]], individual kobolds there referred to the collection of kobolds as the "Kobold Body". 

This is less a faction, per se, and more a way of referring to a community. It came up enough that it's potentially worth noting.
