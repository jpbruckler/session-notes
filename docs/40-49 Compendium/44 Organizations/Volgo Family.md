## Description

[[Silvia Volgo]]

One of the [[7 Powerful Families]]

Within the Volgo Family, there are 4 houses

1. House of Red - [[Elinor]] remembers this house being merceneries - one of the platoons is the [[Red Viper Mercenary Company]]
2. House of Silver - Merchants that own inns, theatres, and smithies. Very artistic, lots of entertainers from here
3. [[House of Mystics]] - potentially linked to the [[Church of Surma]], this is a religious house
4. House of Worg - a pair of Wizard Towers [[Worg Arcadia]] that specialize in uncovering artifacts. Potential friction here between the [[Battle Mage Assembly]]
