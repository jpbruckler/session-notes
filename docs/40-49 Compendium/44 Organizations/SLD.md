>The edge goes to the one with the best information and knows how to use it.

## Purpose/Goals

- Information is a crucial resource that must be sought, found, and possessed.
- Knowledge is valuable and can be well worth its cost
- Unlife is truly evil and takes away a creatureâ€™s right to a natural life
- Creating undead is the worst kind of slavery


## Description

SLD is an organization that collects and brokers in information. Offices of the SLD can be found in many locations throughout the known world, including nearly all major cities. They are considered by most to be a positive force. Historically, they have advised lords and leaders with the desire to create better and equitable governing. SLD tries to exclude itself from politics. This has caused it to have limited influence in the [[Confederation of Independent City-States|CIC]].
