This book is written in dwarven. It describes an other-planar land of thick jungles with oppressive humidity. Most of the vegetation is blood-red surrounded by craggy mountains. The cloudless crimson sky has a multitude of portals opening to other realms. It describes elephants, giant centipedes, spiders, will-o-wisps, and demons (especially an aggressive, soul eating fiend known as a nabassus)
