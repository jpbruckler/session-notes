
This is a thin book with a leather binding with some chapters written in Undercommon. The Undermist is a subterranean level found between the [[Underdark]] and the Underground (below ground, under the Surface). It is a frightful place of porous rock and an unnatural smoke-filled atmosphere. Visibility is limited even with dwarven darkvision, with some spots restricting visibility to inches. This guide describes travel through the Undermist. It describes difficulty seeing, the native mist (more like smoke than mist), the futility of trying to expel the mist, and the denizens of the level. These denizens include [[will-o-wisps]] and "[[ash whisperers]]" and little else. Ash whisperers are creatures that appear as a plume of ash. The take and dish out little physical damage but can cause incredible mental anguish. The Undermist is sometimes referred to as the Netherground.)
