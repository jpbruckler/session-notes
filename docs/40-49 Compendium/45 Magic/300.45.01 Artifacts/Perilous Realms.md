# Perilous Realms

## Notes

Book currently held by [[Hopeful]].

A book that is as much a collection of papers as it is a book. [[Hopeful]] plans to read this book written in common. (The Perilous Realms – An elven traveler named [[Llastoray]] wrote this book describing several realms that he considers inhospitable. They include a mountainous region in the western [[Barrier Mountains]] that is home to [[Argorgantis the Devourer]] (elder white dragon), a desolate place deep in the swamps to the west that is home to [[Yither the Eternal]] (elder black dragon), a razed land called [[Nowhere]] which contains the remains of the [[Eternal One]], a diverse subterranean city called [[Drinverth]] ruled by a druegar king, and a portal that leads to a long forgotten region similar to this land with a large corrupted port city called [[Waterdeep]].)
