related:: summary:: Info For the purposes of this note, 016-20220913 will be assumed to be the day that the party spoke with John Brunis , the Count of Eor . The 2 weeks of downtime was partially covered with the part of the session where people were looking for magic items, shopping, etc. What follows is a description of things the party did, set in motion, etc; during the 2 weeks of downtime. Much of this is \"flavor\", and only exists for the purposes of storytelling. Chapter 1: The Feast After meeting with the Count ( John Brunis ), and receiving accolades, titles, and land, the parties' heads were swimming a bit in the new found fame. They never set out to become nobility (it's fair to say that becoming a noble wasn't something that Gwen had ever thought about, except maybe in a bad dream), yet here they were. Sore and still tired from hours of hard riding, a feast, however, was very much a welcome thought. The castle chamberlain (whom the party are now formally introduced to - his name is Ryland Saing ) sees to the party's various requests. As they are relayed to him, an adolescent girl keeps notes on the requests. He never raises an eyebrow or makes a face at anything the party asks for, and gives no outward indication of how he feels about the new nobility. Once the requests have been made, Ryland informs the party that their belongings have been moved from The Green Tankard into rooms within the Castle, as befitting their new rank. Party Insight Eris - you note that many of the people within the castle walls are armed, even those sitting close to the count. Not so many that the unarmed person looks out of place, but you get the sense that the Count is a pragmatic man, and one used to fighting, or at least one used to needing to have a blade handy. That sense of pragmatism extends to how the castle is run, there's less an air of \"high court\" and more an air of military precision. Many of the members of The Legion of the Emerald Goat have been on the outskirts of social status for much of their lives, so being thrust into the limelight, handed land and titles, while certainly exciting, didn't immediately sink in.

Making their way through the streets they're stopped more than once by folks whom the party's actions had impacted for the better. Discounts were freely given at merchants, children looked upon the party with awe as they walked past, it was a lot to take in. The afternoon soon faded to evening and the members of the party all found themselves seated on either side of the count at the head table during the feast. The feast took place outside the palace, nobility and commoner alike were invited to attend. Before the food was brought out, the Count formally introduced the party as the new Barons of Aldwulf , which was met with a round of applause by everyone gathered. The mead and food flowed freely, and during the dinner several bards told tales about the history of Vendare , the troubles they'd had with Sakatha , and all manner of tales of derring-do. At one point the party was surprised to see Pluck , the minstrel they met while on the road to Sakatha 's lair, was there. He sang a ballad he had written about the party, felling a dragon, braving the dangers of the swamp, laying low the host of fiends that fought in Sakatha 's name. The feast went on well into the evening. When the party finally retired to their rooms they did so with red noses, full bellies, and smiles on their faces. Chapter 2: The First Week The next morning the new Barons awoke with the sun and made their way to the great hall to eat and plan their day. As they discussed their plans, Ryland Saing approached to inform them that buyers had been engaged on the party members' behalf to find any leads on magic items in the area. He also informed the party that the refugees that they had liberated from Sakatha , as well as nearly 100 more men, women, and children that had been rounded up from nearby bandit camps were expected back in the city within the next day or so. Eris Eris was provided with economic and cultural details regarding the Barony of Aldwulf , as well as some brief history of how the Barony came to be founded, and some details regarding the requirements the Barons would owe the Count. They were also introduced to Tarik Delad , the current steward of the Aldwulf estate. Tarik was happy to see that the Aldwulf barony would once again be occupied by people who had done much for the inhabitants of Vendare . Tarik is quite old, approching his 78th year, and with no heirs. Goradaar The proprietor of \"Aqua Vitae\", and alchemical shop specializing in potions and elixers for the affluent had agreed to sharing his laboratory space, stating tat he would be honored to work alongside one of the Heroes of Vendare . The time spent in the lab was very fruitful. During the first few days Goradaar was able to prove his hypothesis regarding the use of monster biologial material in the production of new alchemical concoctions, and within the next couple of days was able to create: 2 vials of Fire Grease 1 vial of Acid Fog Gwen Gwen found a jeweller that made her a necklace and a circlet of silver and brass shaped like mistletoe in exchange for some of the gems she had.

Leaving the castle and city early in the morning and spending time in the wilderness working on her form with the scimitar and wild shaping into all manner of beasts. During one of her excursions she happened upon an old man resting on a stump just off of a deer trail. When she approached he introduced himself as Gwit'hlan Scouzec , the local druid. Gwen and he spoke for several days, and over the course of the conversations she found that there is a Druid Grove in the Barony of Aldwulf that has been without a Druid to keep it for the last 30 years. Gwit'hlan had been tending it up until a year ago when it became too much travel for him. The grove is ancient, the tree at the center being well over 1,500 years old. The old druid is sure that the grove is healthy, but wondered if Gwen would be able to look in on it, as she's been made a Baron of the area. Maggie Maggie was called to Jorlon 's study on the third day after the feast. When she arrived, Jorlon smiled at her - a rather uncharacteristic response to her presence. On his desk was a box made of a dark wood. A likeness of Tymora had been inlaid on the top of the box in mother of pearl with gold accents. Jorlon explained that he had heard of Maggie 's request to find a Devotee's Censer to take with her on this new path she had been set upon. In the box was the Censer, Jorlon 's most prized possession. He explained that it was given to him when he set out during his younger years in support of military operations in the region by the then High Priest of the church. \"A week ago I would never have dreamed I'd be passing it on to you, of all the Lady's clerics. I can't deny though that you have been changed by this business with Sakatha . You have a purpose about you, and I can think of no better owner for it than you.\" Maggie was moved by the gesture, and insisted on making a donation to the church to the tune of 14,000gp. Tsakor The chamberlain informed Tsakor that the man he was looking for had been located already. His name was Quinn Crewe , and he could be brought to the castle if Tsakor preferred. Otherwise he could be found near the outskirts of town where some temporary lodging had been erected for refugees that had made their way to the city. Quinn is serving the refugees, many of whom can't pay, out of his own reserves and pockets. Tsakor offers 50gp to help cover the cost of feeding the camp, and an additional 15gp to help Quinn get back on his feet. In addition to that, Tsakor offers Quinn a job as his representative at the manor house, with the goal being to keep Tsakor informed of the goings on there, and correspond with Tsakor should any Chapter 3: The Second Week","title":"After Session 16"},{"location":"Campaigns/DotMM/Handouts/After%20Session%2016/#after-session-16","text":"Info","title":"After Session 16"},{"location":"Campaigns/DotMM/Handouts/After%20Session%2016/#metadata","text":"campaign:: [[32.01 DotMM]] related:: summary:: Info For the purposes of this note, 016-20220913 will be assumed to be the day that the party spoke with John Brunis , the Count of Eor .

Maggie , Tsakor , Hani , and Eris , dressed in their finest, all make their way to the front of Castle Vendare, expecting to see one of the Count's carriages waiting for them. Instead they are greeted by a large covered carriage. Roughly square in shape, the exterior wood paneling has lacquered in a glossy black. A delicate filigree in gold leaf is painted on both sides of the carriage, and each of the 4 lanterns that hang from its corners sit on polished brass pedastals. The carriage is drawn by 2 completely black horses, easily 15 hands high. Their manes and tails in intricate braids, with black leather tack adorned with brass tacks all along it. They stand in the night air, steam rising from their bodies and stamping their hooves as though their only desire is to be off running again. The driver sits atop the carraige in a fine deep purple coat and tri-corn hat. The carriage door is open, and 2 of the Count's footmen help you all inside. The interior is just as fine as the exterior. The seats are upholstered in a deep brown leather, buttoned to form a diamond pattern across them. There are windows to the rear and sides. At each window is a short curtain for privacy. Once you're all in and settled, you hear a crack of a whip and the sound of steel-shoed hooves on cobblestone as the carriage lurches forward. In what seems like no time at all the carriage is slowing to a stop. Pulling back the curtains you see a large white mansion before you, with blue tile roof. The doors to the carriage are opened by footmen wearing deep purple coats, white undershirts, white gloves and black patent leather shoes. As you step out of the carriage you note that at least 2 hours have passed since you left Castle Vendare, though it seemed like only a few minutes ride.

The butler introduces himself as Gabrielle Langlaise with a deep bow. He has fine features and pale skin, his eyes are a very light blue. It's hard to tell how old (or young?) he is, but he has a welcoming manor and any strangeness you had concerning the apparent discrepancy in time fades away as he greets you all warmly and leads you into the ch\u00e2teau. \" Lord Scouzec \" (skwuh-zey-k) will be down shortly, please allow me to take your coats and make you comfortable.\" He snaps his fingers and 4 servants come forward to help you all with your coats and you're led through to a waiting room where spiced wine is served along with some hors d'oeuvres - thinly sliced cucumber with a dill sauce on top of thin crackers, cranberry-fig goat cheese crostini, and bacon wrapped water chestnuts. A roaring fire is in the fireplace, and the chill of the early autumn evening finds no purchase in the room. About 20 minutes later the butler raps the door and announces: \"Your distinguished host, Lord [Gwit'hlan Scouzec](../../../Compendium/People/NPCs/Gwit'hlan Scouzec.md), Magister of Menloth, Keeper of the Flame of Arnoch, First of the Seven!\" A tall man enters the room. He is dressed in a dark navy robe that looks like padded satin with an embroidered pattern on it. Beneath the robe, dark pants, a cream colored shirt, and black boots show. Lord Scouzec is dark skinned, with white hair. Pointed ears peak from beneath his long hair. The sudden realization that you're in the home of a Drow Lord hits you. Gwit'hlan smiles at you, and you're all a bit surprised to find that it feels like a genuine smile of welcome - something you weren't sure a Drow would ever be able to muster. \"I see that 2 of your number couldn't make it -\" At this point Eris is sure that the missing members of the party would be perceived as some slight. \"- but [Master Delmirev](../../../Compendium/People/Characters/Goradaar Delmirev.md) no doubt is caught up with his research, and I'm given to understand [Misstress Serena](../../../Compendium/People/Characters/Gwenith Serena.md) has recently turned her attention to the care of the forest in your new barony. You all have very recently been presented with many more demands of your time, and so I'm honored that the majority of you were able to attend.\" The slight anxiety creeping up inside of Eris at the thought of starting the evening by offending their host subsides. \"Shall we go through to dinner? I'd love to hear of your adventures direct from you.\" You follow Lord Scouzec through into the dining hall. The table is large enough to seat at least 30 people, though only 5 places are set. The head of the table, and 2 places on either side. As you are shown to your seats you're able to take in the room that you're in. The room is rectangular in shape, and 4 pillars are built into each of the longer walls. The shorter walls both have cathedral style windows in them. Following the pillars up, you would expect to see a cathedral style ceiling - instead what you see is a night sky lit up with twinkling stars, a moon, and the occasional shooting star. Your host is a practiced one, and between the spiced wine, the rich food, the warmth of the fire and his gracious nature you wile away the hours with stories of your exploits assisting the Count and driving out Sakatha . Note Charisma checks needed from everyone attending. - Failing the check means that the interaction with the Mad Mage is revealed - A successful check means that detail is kept to yourselves As the conversation starts to slow and the dinner plates are cleared away, there is a slight change in Gwit'hlan 's demeanor that Maggie picks up on. \"Well then, to business.

Maggie , Tsakor , Hani , and Eris , dressed in their finest, all make their way to the front of Castle Vendare, expecting to see one of the Count's carriages waiting for them. Instead they are greeted by a large covered carriage. Roughly square in shape, the exterior wood paneling has lacquered in a glossy black. A delicate filigree in gold leaf is painted on both sides of the carriage, and each of the 4 lanterns that hang from its corners sit on polished brass pedastals. The carriage is drawn by 2 completely black horses, easily 15 hands high. Their manes and tails in intricate braids, with black leather tack adorned with brass tacks all along it. They stand in the night air, steam rising from their bodies and stamping their hooves as though their only desire is to be off running again. The driver sits atop the carraige in a fine deep purple coat and tri-corn hat. The carriage door is open, and 2 of the Count's footmen help you all inside. The interior is just as fine as the exterior. The seats are upholstered in a deep brown leather, buttoned to form a diamond pattern across them. There are windows to the rear and sides. At each window is a short curtain for privacy. Once you're all in and settled, you hear a crack of a whip and the sound of steel-shoed hooves on cobblestone as the carriage lurches forward. In what seems like no time at all the carriage is slowing to a stop. Pulling back the curtains you see a large white mansion before you, with blue tile roof. The doors to the carriage are opened by footmen wearing deep purple coats, white undershirts, white gloves and black patent leather shoes. As you step out of the carriage you note that at least 2 hours have passed since you left Castle Vendare, though it seemed like only a few minutes ride.

The party decided to finish out the rest of the day in Finethir's Tower , starting their 12 day trip to the Palace of Eor in the morning. During the debate on whether they should stay or go (and presumably if there would be trouble), Tsakor asked who the leader of the group was, and indicated he was good at dealing with people, so the party decided he would be their spokesperson/president, and that the party would act as a democracy. DM\u2019s insight: Tsakor never really said how he was good at dealing with people, just that he was good at \u201cdealing\u201d with people. The first night on the road, in the middle of the night, Tsakor heard\u2026 something, he just wasn\u2019t sure what he heard. Casting light on a coin and throwing it near the sound, he was able to see a humanoid face with reddish skin - Hobgoblin bandits. 1 exploding hammer was all it took to rid themselves of the hobgoblins, their equipment was sold later for 210GP. On the way to Eor , a giant ape was seen off the side of the road. Tsakor caught the Kent the Ape 's eye, and displayed his territorial nature through much grunting and beating of his chest. Tsakor , in a moment of brilliance, was able to intimidate the Ape into backing down (for this, Don was awarded Inspiration ) The party saw the Ape once again the next day, this time eating some 75-100' from the road. The party bumped into a couple a bit down the road and warned them about the Ape up ahead. The couple told the party that the Ape was named Kent and was quite a helper during the harvest. The party was able to stop at an inn for an evening. As they lay sleeping, someone attempted to break into their room, and eventually was able to spring the lock and open the door. It was just a halfling boy ( Daniel Swiftwhistle ), who tried telling Tsakor that the he found the door open and was just trying to close it for them. Tsakor , having been aware of the lock picking, pushed the boy down and issued a stern warning to stay away from the party. The next morning, they saw the boy was working at the inn, clearing tables. On the 8th day, Goradaar heard 4 wolves in the distance and was sure that there was a 5th \u2018something\u2019 with the wolves. The party kept going, but with an eye out for trouble. Soon, a single, large wolf appeared on the road in front of them. Olahna summoned a Black Bear and advanced, Hani hid behind Tsakor . The wolves advanced as well, trying to surround the party. It wasn\u2019t long before the 5th \u2018something\u2019 revealed itself - an Ettin who spent the first part of combat arguing with itself.","title":"003-20210415"},{"location":"Campaigns/DotMM/Session%20Notes/003-20210415/#003-20210415","text":"Info campaign:: [[32.01 DotMM|Dungeon of the Mad Mage]] date:: 2021-04-15 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: John Bruckler Last Session: 002-20210304 Info ^summary","title":"003-20210415"},{"location":"Campaigns/DotMM/Session%20Notes/003-20210415/#session-log","text":"DM\u2019s note: This is going to be pretty Tsakor heavy, as I borrowed Don\u2019s notes - my dog ate mine.

On the way to Eor , a giant ape was seen off the side of the road. Tsakor caught the Kent the Ape 's eye, and displayed his territorial nature through much grunting and beating of his chest. Tsakor , in a moment of brilliance, was able to intimidate the Ape into backing down (for this, Don was awarded Inspiration ) The party saw the Ape once again the next day, this time eating some 75-100' from the road. The party bumped into a couple a bit down the road and warned them about the Ape up ahead. The couple told the party that the Ape was named Kent and was quite a helper during the harvest. The party was able to stop at an inn for an evening. As they lay sleeping, someone attempted to break into their room, and eventually was able to spring the lock and open the door. It was just a halfling boy ( Daniel Swiftwhistle ), who tried telling Tsakor that the he found the door open and was just trying to close it for them. Tsakor , having been aware of the lock picking, pushed the boy down and issued a stern warning to stay away from the party. The next morning, they saw the boy was working at the inn, clearing tables. On the 8th day, Goradaar heard 4 wolves in the distance and was sure that there was a 5th \u2018something\u2019 with the wolves. The party kept going, but with an eye out for trouble. Soon, a single, large wolf appeared on the road in front of them. Olahna summoned a Black Bear and advanced, Hani hid behind Tsakor . The wolves advanced as well, trying to surround the party. It wasn\u2019t long before the 5th \u2018something\u2019 revealed itself - an Ettin who spent the first part of combat arguing with itself.","title":"Session Log"},{"location":"Campaigns/DotMM/Session%20Notes/004-20210513/","tags":["ttrpg/session/dotmm"],"text":"004-20210513 Info campaign:: [[32.01 DotMM|Dungeon of the Mad Mage]] date:: 2021-05-13 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: John Bruckler Last Session: 003-20210415 Info ^summary Session Log We rejoin our merry band of misfits 8 days into their journey to Eor , as they face down the threat of 4 Dire wolves and an Ettin\u2026 Goradaar was pretty hurt after being bitten by a dire wolf , Gwen had taken the form of a dire wolf, Tsakor had advanced on the Ettin after blowing up his hammer, softening the foes up for the rest of the party. Ohlana created a small cannon to spread \u2764 and HP, and Hani was exploiting holes in her foes' defenses, making them pay dearly. Gwen , with the brutality of the wild animal whose form she had assumed, brought one of the wolves down by tearing out his throat after Hani pierced it through with her rapier. Hani and Gwen made short work of the next wolf as well, with Gwen once more dealing the final blow. Ohlana saved Goradaar \u2019s bacon with her mobile support turret, and while Tsakor was facing down the Ettin, provided some much needed support there as well. Goradaar let fly a mighty fireball, destroying 2 more dire wolves and damaging the Ettin. Tsakor bravely brandished a broadsword in close combat with the Ettin , using his cunning and quick wit to deceive one of the Ettin\u2019s heads into believing the other head was plotting against him. With a mighty slashing blow to the Ettin\u2019s chest, purple flame erupted over the wound freezing the giant-kin with fear. While it was paralyzed with fear, Gwen took her opportunity to land the killing blow, ending the encounter. With the immediate danger passed, Olahna Hanali was able to nurse Goradaar back to health with her incredible tinkered turrets. Loot: Hani found 100gp on the Ettin , and the party split the loot between them. Tsakor took the Ettin \u2019s great axe for himself, and surmised that Goradaar might be able to make use of the great club Bruised, but breathing, the party pushed on for Zymorven Hall, a keep overlooking the main road, and the next bastion of civilization along the Rauvin Road. Tsakor smoothly negotiated room and board with the guard at the front gate, and the party entered the inner courtyard of the keep. Tsakor stabled Cherry near the barracks, then found a semi-quiet place to meditate and perform his Kata. Gwen and Goradaar made their way to the keep\u2019s smithy (Kampe). Goradaar managed to sell the great club to the smith for 30cp and an agreement to leave the premises. Gwen , on the hunt for more martial power, shrewdly negotiated a deal to purchase a longsword for the low price of 20gp. New weapon in hand, she now needed only to find someone to give her some pointers on the finer points of the longsword, she found Goddard , who purported to be the best longswordsman in the land, and would show her the ropes for a mere 30gp. Gwen was\u2026 less than impressed, and declined the offer. Goddard \u2019s other duties include mucking out stalls, which seemed an odd second duty for such a skilled fighter. Eventually she did find a young soldier in training that was all too happy to spar with her, and after half a day Gwen felt she was every bit as good with the longsword as she ever was with a scimitar. Hani took a stroll around the main courtyard and noted that the cooper\u2019s building had been marked by the local thieves guild, indicating that a heist was being planned there later. Satisfied that there were no great treasures awaiting her, she made her way to the mess hall where she found one of the best bowls of pheasant noodle soup she\u2019s tasted this side of the Sword Mountains. Olahna made her way to the farrier\u2019s (Wyatt), looking for bits and bobs for her tinkering. The farrier\u2019s daughter, Ophelia, gathered up a handful of nails and a few horseshoes, charging the princely sum of 3cp. Ohlana, maybe seeing some of her younger self in the girl, paid her a whole gold piece; an act surely worth a favor in the future. Olahna then set off for the general store, needing to find a leather pouch to keep her bits and bobs in. Finding the leather pouch was easy enough, getting out of the store with only a single purchase proved much harder. The proprietress (Edeline) of the store, being a bit of a pushy saleswoman, convinced Ohlana to buy some chalk, as well. \u201cYou never know when it might come in handy, afterall.\u201d Ohlana also greased Edeline\u2019s palm - one can never be owed too many favors. The day came to an end, and while the party was put up in adequate accommodations in the barracks, Tsakor still felt it necessary to keep watch. Hani took first watch, which was largely uneventful other than the snoring of one of the guards. Snoring that was cutting through the peacefulness of the evening and frustrating Hani more and more with each thunderous snore. She snuck into the barracks and tied back the nose of the snoring soldier, reducing the noise to a more ignorable level. Tsakor \u2019s watch also passed without incident, while he crouched in the darkness, keen eyes not missing a single detail. Not a speck of dust moved in the barracks that his watchful eye didn\u2019t take in. Not a sound was uttered that his keen ears didn\u2019t pick up. At the end of his watch, he woke up Gwen - much to her chagrin. Most of Gwen \u2019s watch was spent staring with grave annoyance at Tsakor while he slept. She was sore, and tired, having taken a bit of a beating learning forms and strikes more suitable for the longsword, and Tsakor is waking her from her slumber, to keep watch while they\u2019re surrounded by 50 armed guards. The nerve! Around 4am she watched as a single spider slid down on a gossamer strand of webbing from the ceiling, directly above Tsakor . Just as the spider was about to drop, Tsakor stirred in his sleep, knocking the spider to the floor. Gwen , now robbed of her sleep and the satisfaction of a spider crawling all over Tsakor , walked over to the small arachnid, and with deft fingers placed it back on Tsakor \u2019s face where it waited momentarily before crawling beneath the covers. Tsakor stirred in his sleep as the spider crawled, bringing a giggle and some payback to Gwen .","title":"004-20210513"},{"location":"Campaigns/DotMM/Session%20Notes/004-20210513/#004-20210513","text":"Info campaign:: [[32.01 DotMM|Dungeon of the Mad Mage]] date:: 2021-05-13 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: John Bruckler Last Session: 003-20210415 Info ^summary","title":"004-20210513"},{"location":"Campaigns/DotMM/Session%20Notes/004-20210513/#session-log","text":"We rejoin our merry band of misfits 8 days into their journey to Eor , as they face down the threat of 4 Dire wolves and an Ettin\u2026 Goradaar was pretty hurt after being bitten by a dire wolf , Gwen had taken the form of a dire wolf, Tsakor had advanced on the Ettin after blowing up his hammer, softening the foes up for the rest of the party.

For the next couple of minutes they\u2019re unresponsive. When they come too, they\u2019re both visibly shaken, and share the following: Info \u201cWe saw inside some room, a large lizardfolk was sitting on what seemed like a throne, our viewpoint was from behind and just to the side of it\u2019s head. Kneeling on the ground before him was an armored figure with black hair. He was talking about the attack on the Count just a few days prior. Lizardfolk : Who were those people that interfered at the palace? [[Human]]: They called themselves The Legion of the Emerald Goats . A bunch of adventurers the count had hired to find the reason for all the [[bandit]] attacks. Foolish. He knows the cause of those attacks. Lizardfolk: Do you not know them? It appeared one was helping you? Human: Great King, I know none of those people. It would appear they were betrayed from within, but I know neither who nor why. Lizardfolk: No matter. Every attempt he\u2019s made to resist me has failed. A handful of adventurers won\u2019t change the course of my plans. I know them now and can look upon them whenever I desire. But Mordrin, should your paths cross again, end them. Human: Of course, my Liege. Visited: Waycombe NPC's met: Mordrin The party woke and over breaking down camp discovered they all had similar nightmares.

Maggie then went on to kill the Patriarch , and said, as he died: Info Now you can be with your stupid wand again! \u2014 Maggie She then proceeded to heal the party for a total of 140 HP Hani helped herself to 2 silver candelabra (600gp) from the Patriarch's chambers The party, not heeding concers from Maggie that it would behoove them to rest, continued exploring the chamber, finding a secret door leading to a chest containing: 5000gp 2000pp A small cylindrical ivory case with an ivory stopper in one end ( Goradaar ) The party took a long rest after locking themselves as best they could into the temple room.","title":"Session Log"},{"location":"Campaigns/DotMM/Session%20Notes/012-20220405/","tags":["ttrpg/session/dotmm"],"text":"012-20220405 Info campaign:: [[32.01 DotMM|Dungeon of the Mad Mage]] date:: 2022-04-05 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: John Bruckler Last Session: 011-20220301 Info ^summary Session Log Frustrated at the dead end the demon-cult hallway was, The Legion backtracked to the pervertered altar to try to find a way forward.

Within seconds the door revealed it's true nature - a [[Mimic]]! The battle with the Mimic was over almost as soon as it began, and none the worse for wear, the party continued past the door into a 10' x 10' stone room. The room itself had a door on the North and South walls, but opening those doors revealed nothing but stone behind them. Through some teamwork, a secret door was found that led to another hallway containing a trapdoor. Opening the trapdoor, the party observed a set of stairs leading down into darkness. Recalling the line \"Pas the doors you cannot find, Down the steps you cannot climb\" the party figured that these must be the stairs referenced by the verse. Tsakor and Gwen led the way down the stairs, followed by Maggie , with Goradaar bringing up the back. Roughly 15' down the stairs some of the steps disappeared into thin air, revealing a fiery pit some 30' beneath them. Dextrous Gwen was able to leap aside, but poor Maggie began to plummet to what surely must be her doom. Goradaar instinctively cast [[Spells F#^957536|Feather Fall]], and he and Gwen were able to grab Maggie as her descent was instantly slowed. Gwen pulled Maggie to safety near herself and Tsakor , and with the boots of Levitation, Goradaar made his way across the missing stairs to join his comrades on the other side. The rest of the descent was uneventful. When the party reached the bottom of the stairs, they found themselves in a huge cavern that extended beyond the reach of their vision in all directions. The party moved forward towards the sound of water. As they debated what to do at the river's edge, a raft floated towards them out of the darkness. Maggie attempted to climb aboard the raft, but instead found herself in a dry ditch after a short fall, with no river to be seen. Strangely, she began to take damage as something undetected was burning her. Back above the water Gwen and Tsakor attempted to figure out where Maggie went.

The choice is yours. The showdown between The Legion of the Emerald Goat and Sakatha is here! Sakatha attempted to convince the party to join him as he regained the lands he ruled some 200 years before. The party was not to be persuaded \u2014 given the choice between death and playing 2nd fiddle to some vampiric Lizard, they decided that death ( Sakatha 's, not theirs) was the more agreeable option. During the fight, Gwen was beguiled by Sakatha 's charm and grace, Tsakor hexed the heinous hooligan, delivering devastating damage to the savage serpent scoundrel. Maggie showed up with timely healing, dynamic divine power and powerful protection. Goradaar , though unable to facilitate a firey furnace of fireballs, still handed out hefty helpings of hurt through the arcane arts. As Sakatha fell, he transformed into mist, and was about to head to his coffin to regenerate when time seemed to stop, or everyone was paralyzed or otherwise held in check through some magical force. A wild-looking old mage blinked into existence and with a wave of his staff the mist-that-was-Sakatha was no more. The mage introduced himself as Halaster Blackcloak , and acknowledged the party's prowess, inviting them to visit his abode beneath Waterdeep , through the [[Yawning Portal]]. The party took a long rest. The date at the end of the session is the 8th day of the 12th month (Highharvestide).

Gwen takes a look outside to see a small crowd of cityfolk gathered below. As she pulls the curtain aside, cheers erupt from the people in the street. It seems news of the party's conquests traveled from the depths of the swamps faster than the party itself could. A knock at the door pulls your attention away from the crowd outside. Jaffe Eravan , owner of The Green Tankard , stands outside the door with the air of a man who's importance has suddenly grown overnight. Info News of what you've done for the Count has reached the common folk. It's fine work that you've done, taking care of that lizard once and for all. Many were thinking that was the cause of the problems in the south, but few would say it outright for fear of bringing evil on themselves. Not me of course, I don't go in for superstition. Anyway, there's quite a crowd in the common room, so I've taken the liberty of bringing up some breakfast for you all. When you're finished eating, if you'd like I can show you the back way out of the inn, that should get you to the castle under relative anonymity. The count's already paid for your stay and your food for as long as you stay here, so don't worry about that. Unless you're in need of anything else, I'll leave you to your meal. \u2014 Jaffe Eravan The party ate breakfast, caught up, and discussed their options. During this time: Gwen recounted the dream she had the night before where a man with hair like fire and a cloak of feathers urges her to Undermountain. Tsakor shared with the party that the vampire brides had been destroyed Spending 2 weeks in Vendare , then 2 weeks travel to get to Waterdeep Tsakor summons his Pseudodragon familiar Goradaar shared that he was able to figure out how to make some potions Fire Grease - Fire grease can be applied to the blade of a weapon to add 1d4 Fire damage when a creature is hit with a melee attack. Acid Fog - Acid fog is poured out onto the ground (or from a broken vial) into an area. Within 3 rounds it will spread to a 30' radius causing 1d4 Acid damage to all creatures at the beginning of their turn while in the fog, and will continue causing 1d4 Acid damage for 2 rounds after a creature has left the fog. There was some discussion around whether the party were going to appear at court armed or not (they decided armed was ok), and whether they should take the time to wash up. Eris used her cleansing stone to make them all clean as a whistle - which Gwen decided was an experience she was ulikely to want to repeat. Ultimately the party decided to take Jaffe up on his offer to sneak the party out of the inn. The party followed Jaffe out into the stables, then eventually into the alleyway running behind the businesses on this street. He pointed them in the direction of the castle and made his way back to the Inn. The Legion of the Emerald Goat made their way into the castle, and were immediately seen by the Count. The Count regaled the party with an abridged version of the battle fought by his ancestors some 400 years prior to defeat Sakatha , a battle which was embroidered on a large tapestry hanging on the wal behind the count. The count also informed them that were was to be a banquet in their honor that night, and the next 2 weeks would be a festival, celebrating the liberation from Sakatha, and the return of many of the inhabitants of Vendare . During the conversation with the count: - Gwen requested jerky at the feast (granted) - Tsakor - asked if Maggie could join them ( Jorlon granted the request) - asked if there were any purveyor of magical goods - The count directed him to the chamberlain - Also asked about the tapestry, and the count provided a brief history of the family - Goradaar - Asked about access to alchemical tooling - The count once again directed the party to the chamberlain - Eris - History of the barony, including imports and exports - Any obligations that the the barony would have to the Count - How to not piss off the locals - Once again they were directed to the chamberlain Dispersal of party funds accumulated so far: [[Treasure#016-20220913]] Downtime Tsakor 1.

Unless you're in need of anything else, I'll leave you to your meal. \u2014 Jaffe Eravan The party ate breakfast, caught up, and discussed their options. During this time: Gwen recounted the dream she had the night before where a man with hair like fire and a cloak of feathers urges her to Undermountain. Tsakor shared with the party that the vampire brides had been destroyed Spending 2 weeks in Vendare , then 2 weeks travel to get to Waterdeep Tsakor summons his Pseudodragon familiar Goradaar shared that he was able to figure out how to make some potions Fire Grease - Fire grease can be applied to the blade of a weapon to add 1d4 Fire damage when a creature is hit with a melee attack. Acid Fog - Acid fog is poured out onto the ground (or from a broken vial) into an area. Within 3 rounds it will spread to a 30' radius causing 1d4 Acid damage to all creatures at the beginning of their turn while in the fog, and will continue causing 1d4 Acid damage for 2 rounds after a creature has left the fog. There was some discussion around whether the party were going to appear at court armed or not (they decided armed was ok), and whether they should take the time to wash up. Eris used her cleansing stone to make them all clean as a whistle - which Gwen decided was an experience she was ulikely to want to repeat. Ultimately the party decided to take Jaffe up on his offer to sneak the party out of the inn. The party followed Jaffe out into the stables, then eventually into the alleyway running behind the businesses on this street. He pointed them in the direction of the castle and made his way back to the Inn. The Legion of the Emerald Goat made their way into the castle, and were immediately seen by the Count. The Count regaled the party with an abridged version of the battle fought by his ancestors some 400 years prior to defeat Sakatha , a battle which was embroidered on a large tapestry hanging on the wal behind the count. The count also informed them that were was to be a banquet in their honor that night, and the next 2 weeks would be a festival, celebrating the liberation from Sakatha, and the return of many of the inhabitants of Vendare . During the conversation with the count: - Gwen requested jerky at the feast (granted) - Tsakor - asked if Maggie could join them ( Jorlon granted the request) - asked if there were any purveyor of magical goods - The count directed him to the chamberlain - Also asked about the tapestry, and the count provided a brief history of the family - Goradaar - Asked about access to alchemical tooling - The count once again directed the party to the chamberlain - Eris - History of the barony, including imports and exports - Any obligations that the the barony would have to the Count - How to not piss off the locals - Once again they were directed to the chamberlain Dispersal of party funds accumulated so far: [[Treasure#016-20220913]]","title":"Session Log"},{"location":"Campaigns/DotMM/Session%20Notes/016-20220913/#downtime","text":"Tsakor 1.

The party met with Alex , who informed them of several murders in the town, and thought since they seemed to be the helping kind, they might be interested in investigating. ^summary Session Log At 10 AM on the 3rd month, 22nd day, of year 31 AR, our story begins. Fuzula Fastbritches and Kereshi Khill entered Fowlerville from the west and headed for the Rested Moose Inn . When they reached the steps, they saw Olseris and Eljas eating/smoking on the porch of the inn after staying the night. As they were arriving, all heck broke loose up the road where people were preparing for the Fowlerville Parade. An orc champion accompanied with three orcs leaped out an began attacking other parade participants and bystanders. The party (to be) didn't have an opportunity to see the goblin firebug rush to the back of the Fleet Foot Stables . Ten to fifteen seconds later, the driver of the wagon the orcs snuck into town to make sure the fire had been started. The party, an elf named Bronson , and two guards engaged the orcs. While Fuzula did massive damage to the orc champion, Kereshi landed the killing blow on two regular orcs and the orc champion. The other Orc ran for woods. Bronson landed a solid hit on him, but Fuzula put him down with another excellent shot. The goblins were dropped by Eljas and Olseris . During the battle, Kereshi noticed the Fleet Foot Stables was on fire. After the battle, the group helped guards and townspeople put out the flames. A bucket brigade worked to save the barn. Allison Ramshold helped the downed townspeople before working on saving her business. The cleric of [[Rauni]] came to assist with create water. The stable sustained significant damage, but luckily the battle was ended quickly allowing the flames to be fought. After the fire, Bronson invited to buy a drink for the adventurers. Fuzula wanted lots of pancakes instead. Not everyone sat at the table, but they did share information about themselves. Olseris challenged Bronson , as people don't offer drinks for no reason. Bronson claimed it was out of appreciation for the work they did. He also admitted that he had an upcoming meeting that he was hoping to find a few people to take with him if he found someone that would be helpful. But he reiterated that the drinks were simply out of his appreciation. A guard, Annabella with a nasty bruise, approached their table and asked if they would meet with Alex , the senior Peacekeeper in Fowlerville . They did. Alex stated that there were 3 murders in Fowlerville in the last week; 2 goblin attacks and a witness who thought they saw a strangulation at the upscale Crouching Dragon Tavern and Inn. While the suspicion wasn't enough for the Peacekeepers to infringe on the town's closed investigation, their assistance in the defense of the town made the Constable, Krisvyre , willing to let them do a follow-up investigation. He would see if he could get them paid for killing the orcs out of it. They went to see Krisvyre and she was happier about their assistance since she knew a couple of them. They learned a little about the events and waited to ask Aster , the investigating constable, a few questions when he got back. Deputy constable Aster provided some basic information and offered to show them where the goblin attack happened, but some of the party was suspicious of him. The party went a few different directions. Fuzula followed Krisvyre to the wealthy estates, a walled section that housed some of the wealthy townspeople; supposedly to check up on something (a shut-in). She was there for approximately 20 minutes and then returned to the jail. She told Aster she was going home when she left the jail. Kereshi went to talk to the witness. Urgala , a half-orc covered in wax, saw the attack. Although she couldn't be \"100% certain\" that it wasn't a male described as a female or vice versa, she was confident she saw a tall male with a beard strangle a woman. Then he blew out the light. Eljas went to talk to the manager of the Crouching Dragon Tavern . While she didn't like him in the building, he talked her into telling him about the man. He appeared to be a wealthy merchant. He was tall with a bushy beard and a lot of hair. After staying that night, he slipped out and she didn't see him again. Eljas purposely then left a dusty mess on the way out the door. Olseris went to check out the site of two of the murders. He discovered the location in a clearing about 80-100 yards short of a 5' tall rock. A slight trail led to a clearing. He found a crude short sword and two goblin arrows, one whole and one broken. There wasn't much blood for this to be the site of two murders, but there was plenty of traffic around the area for a fight to have happened. The trail that led into the clearing from the road continued out the other side. Taking the items with him with the intent to talk to Grux at the Fleet Foot Stables , he headed back. The group returned to the Rested Moose Inn and join forces again.","title":"001-20200130"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/001-20200130/#001-20200130","text":"Info campaign:: SumonHo date:: 2022-09-25 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: Don Warnecke Last Session: [[undefined]] Info The not-yet-formed party helped the citizens of Fowelerville turn back an orc attack.

They learned Mary makes baskets, selling them as well as baked goods. Aster also said they were killed by short sword thrusts and arrows. He said that the party could learn more from Lesdyl at the Clinic of Healing . They also learned where LM and Mary lived, a small farmhouse although LM worked in the mines. The party was accepting Aster \u2019s help escorting them once they get back from the clinic. He said he would grab a Fowlerville scout to assist. While Fuzula , Kereshi , and Olseris went to the clinic, Eljas headed to The Crouching Dragon Tavern to ask another question. They learned from Lesdyl that LM was stabbed twice in the gut and had an arrow in his shoulder. Mary , his wife, had two arrows including one right at her heart. In discussion, none of the arrows were very deep nor did they show much signs of bleeding. She also had a bruise on her face like she was punched. After further discussion, Lesdyl remembered Mary also had some minor bruising in the neck area. LM was filthy on his back, but Mary didn\u2019t have much in the way of mud or dirt.

He said he didn\u2019t learn anything at the CDT , as the manager was being a jerk because of \u201ca little dirt\u201d he left on the floor last time. They all returned to the jail to see Aster and Vadania , an elven guardswoman, returning to the jail to meet them. They headed first to the mine. They kept an eye out for drag marks. Along the way to the mine, at the wide stream near the large rock Olseris had seen earlier that day, they saw a few lumps in the stream. Approaching, Fuzula realized they were moving, there were at least 3, and she saw a claw. They were 5 giant crabs. She also realized there were some tracks in the soft ground by the large rock. Checking it out, someone appeared to have waited behind the rock for a while and there was also a bloody hand print on the rock. They also found a place along the tree line where it looked like a body was rested and bled in the grass. When they arrived at the Riverside Mine , Vadania stayed on the edge of the tent camp. Elias decided to stay with her. Olseris was able to persuade the assistant manager Anton that it would be better to interrupt the teams work to ask a few questions than to have to be much more disruptive if they had to be more official. Anton was very interested in as little interruption to production as possible. The party questioned Eddie , Marty, and the dwarf Adrik in the supply room. Fuzula noticed Marty wore an expensive chain around his neck that was very out of place. However, Olseris suggested she needed to talk to Aster outside before she could use or share the information. It got him out of the room. Olseris bribed Eddie with a couple coins trying to get him to level with them about what he knew. Eddie seemed to concoct odd stories about LM . Marty ended up overextending the conversation, admitting that the crew took gems from LM \u2019s dead body, only later to admit that only Eddie was there. It was also discussed that LM found some gems in the mine and didn\u2019t turn them in. Eddie was visibly relieved when Olseris said that he didn\u2019t care about the stolen gems, he just wanted to know what Eddie knew about LM , and the group was leaving now. On the way back, the group stopped by the place where the bodies were found. They went through the small clearing and the path led to a much larger clearing, more like a small meadow. The found 3 goblins killed a few weeks ago. One appeared to be killed by a spear and the other two by arrows with Grux \u2019s signature fletching; 2 green and 1 red. One of the corpses was missing a short sword. Looking around, Fuzula found a wig, fake beard, and what looked like \u2018cover up\u2019 makeup. On second look, the makeup container had coal residue on it. The party went over what they knew and what they strongly suspected with Aster . The party were thinking of ways they could get Urgala to try to confirm Eddie in the wig and beard looked like the silhouette she had seen. Aster said he could help them finish out finding facts, but also they could bring Krisvyre in because they could arrest him over the gems and further officially investigate since they had proven there was something more sinister than a goblin attack. The Constables would better be able to compel Eddie to do things like put the beard on to be viewed by the witness. Aster had the scout run and get Krisvyre while the party returned to the mine to make sure he didn\u2019t escape, although since Olseris basically told him he was in the clear no one expected him to make a run for it. Krisvyre arrived and arrested Eddie . Olseris took his 2 gold pieces back and gave Anton the 2 amethyst gems LM found in the mine; which were in Eddie \u2019s pocket. Eddie looked furious but couldn\u2019t do anything about it while shackled by the Constable. When Senior Peacekeeper Alex saw the group coming into town, he met them in the street. He gave them 40 gp for the [[orc]] bounty. *Ellias\u2019s 10 gp were added to his D&D Beyond inventory. The party went into the Rested Moose for dinner. They saw Bronson at the bar talking to an elf in robes and with a longbow. Bronson and the elf were finishing their conversation and the elf left about 10 minutes after the party sat down. The party invited Bronson over about 45 minutes later as he was looking over at the table several times. He said he didn\u2019t come over because he could tell they didn\u2019t trust him, although he didn\u2019t have any idea why. Bronson was invited to join them at the table and he did. While eating, a young man, barely more than a boy, approached the table and addressed Fuzula . He asked if they would come speak to Vivien Powell at the Welcome Spot. They agreed to come when they were done with their meal. At the Welcome Spot, they learned that Vivian\u2019s son and daughter are missing. They went to investigate the Fortress Down Under as adventurers. Vivian said she would give $200 per child returned or, in the case they were deceased, $50 per signet ring returned. From her perspective, they could have anything they found except the signet rings. Kereshi believes she knows the site Vivian is speaking about. They agreed to investigate. At that, they went for a little shopping trip. Kereshi bought a wet stone and a sledge hammer. Fuzual replaced some spent arrows. And the party took a well-deserved long rest.

At that, they went for a little shopping trip. Kereshi bought a wet stone and a sledge hammer. Fuzual replaced some spent arrows. And the party took a well-deserved long rest. In the morning, the party got up for breakfast. They are now prepared to search out the Fortress Down Under .

Along the way, the party found a down-on-her-luck and shackled bard named Elinor . Elinor joined the party. They found the ravine that the fortress is in. Kereshi led the way and was attacked by 3 giant rats. The party entered the fortress's tower from the dark courtyard. The party went left through the tower and found a magically locked door that they couldn't get through. The party went through the right door in the tower and eventually found Meepo weeping because the clan's pet dragon was stolen by goblins. Meepo tried to convince the party to retrieve the dragon for the kobolds and took them to Yusdrayl Yusdrayl agreed the party could have safe passage through her territory and the key from the dragon head's mouth if they returned the dragon. Meepo can travel with them. You're getting hungry. You may want to consider taking a short rest. The party left Fowlerville for the Fortress Down Under at approximately 8 am. The directions that you were given include following the Old Road, a road that was once a major thoroughway and has seen limited use recently. Headed northeast, it is overgrown at areas but still clear enough for general use. You have been told to go about 8 miles, which should take most of 3 hours to cover. You will come to a trail that leads passed a small run-down, one room shack. If you keep going a little farther, a ravine will be 200 feet off the road. The ' Fortress Down Under ' is in the ravine. Some 2 hours into the trip, Bronson , Olseris , and Fuzula saw a humanoid traveling along the road but off in cover about 300 ft away. Elinor was shackled and when they approached each other she asked if they could help her. Since she told Eljas she wouldn't attack them if they freed her, they considered how they could help. Bronson sheepishly picked the lock, although he stated that his tools were not thieves' tools; there just tools. Freeing Elinor , the party learned of her predicament and invited her to travel with them. She accepted. They traveled on for just over another hour. On the north side of the road, you can see one of many trails that have led off the Old Road. It is a nondescript trail a few feet wide. The Old Road is wide and clear here, so you can see a small wooden structure about 60 ft off the road. It would be easy to see if it wasn't for the thick vegetation that grows over the entirety of the structure, nearly obscuring it. If you weren't looking for it, the shack may have been hard to find. Based on your directions, the ravine shouldn't be much farther. After spending some time looking for Elinor 's companions to no avail, they searched for and found its collapsed pillars and the rope tied to one. Kereshi climbed down 40' and was attacked by 3 giant rats. Two were killed from above and Kereshi threw the last one over the side. The party took the roughhewn stairs zig-zagging the 80' to the bottom of the ravine. Looking around the courtyard of the Fortress Down Under , Olseris found a pit trap in front of the door to the tower. Identifying the 2' catwalk and wedging the door closed, the party safely entered the fortress. Olseris peered through the right door and the party went through the left. They only made it into one room. Elinor , borrowing Bronson 's tools, was able to unlock the door. After Kereshi killed the giant rat that killed Fuzula , Elinor cast detect magic. She saw that the key hole in the mouth of the dragon carved in relief in the stone door glowed of magic. The party headed back to the left door in the tower. Heading down that hallway, the party found two doors. The one on the left was locked and had a stone dragon-like fish swimming attached to a wooden door. Kereshi knocked the door open with his sledge hammer. Within, a keg with pipes into the floor held a pair of steam and frost creatures that didn't want to be disturbed. Both Olseris and Fuzula caught a face full of damaging air (frosty air or steam) in the exchange. There was some consternation on how much time to spend on them, with some members leaving before others. The other room across the hall was empty. The door at the end of the hall led to a very distraught kobold named Meepo . His clan's wyrmling white dragon has been captured by goblins and he tried to get the party to commit to retrieving it. Kereshi found 4 white scales. Meepo led the characters to Yusdrayl , leader of the kobolds. She sat on a short throne constructed of fallen bits of masonry stacked against an old altar. The alter had a few small items on it. The portion of the alter that served as the throne's back had a carving of a rearing dragon. A metallic key is held in its open jaws. Eljas and Queen Yusdrayl agreed to cooperate.

In the battle, Elinor cast the sleep spell that dropped Durnn the hobgoblin [[Goblin Boss]], Grenl the goblin shaman, and another [[hobgoblin]] soldier. Bronson killed one of the hobgoblins while it slept. Durnn and Grenl were tied up. Elinor dropped a light spell illuminated stone to the bottom of the shaft.

She must weigh the risk of staying vs the risk of leaving. Grenl said a man named Belak , or the Outcast , was down the shaft. After killing one in a fit of rage, Durnn had sent the other two members of the Powell party down to Belak . She also said that if they went down there (i.e. was handed over to the Outcast ), they can\u2019t be saved. It was suggested if Grenl made sure they wouldn\u2019t be attacked through the dungeon by goblins, the party could spare the goblins despite their deal with the kobolds. She said if she was set free she could communicate it to her other warrior goblins on this level. The Durbuluk Tribe has worked with the Outcast more closely since Durnn\u2019s arrival. The party had talked about going down after the signet ring and armor, but also since they are here for the \u201ckids\u201d and one of them is down there with the Outcast . When looking down the well, Durnn \u2019s body was no longer visible. From Don: The time between sessions will be seconds for the characters, but I'd hate to have the players spend all week thinking about what to do next and then get a more concise version of things at the beginning of the session that throws their thoughts in a tailspin. So I am sending this out ahead of our next session although it makes it a narration instead of a dialog. Below is the information the goblin will relay at the beginning of the next session. Throughout the 'conversation,' Grenl would be looking at Eljas , who spoke of the agreement with the kobolds, and Fuzula , who spoke like she was concerned about the tribe's safety. When she mentions the dragon, she would glance at Kereshi . I will look out for the safety of my tribe. You don't understand the risk of looking for a new home; especially leaving one this nice which we have lived in for decades. The kobold threat is less than the risk out there. We can't just move into a house outside of your town, now can we? But I would rather face the uncertainty out there to our childern with my remaining warriors than to face the kobolds without my warriors. 1. If you are really willing to break your deal with the kobolds, I will spread the word that you have safe passage up here while you explore below. I will have gotten the word out in that time. The might of the goblins and kobolds can continue to work on each other for mastery of this citadel. You have weakened us a bunch, but I believe we can still overcome those dogs. I'm willing to give it a try. 2. If you are really willing to break your deal and do the right thing, we could work together to expell the kobolds. If your trick to control the dragon works as you think it does, getting rid of us only lets them have the keep with an immense power. Together, we could defeat them by encouraging a group of them to pursue my warriors and we destroy them. Then attacking them where they rest on their pompous throne. Maybe your trick can be used to destroy the dragon. 3. If you are actually intent on pushing us out so the newcomers can have our home, as I said we would sooner leave than have you kill our warriors one at a time. But it is not due to fear of the kobolds. If you are intent on freeing up the kobolds to settle into this keep, we will leave. Despite our differences, Durnn and the hobgoblins were mighty warriors. Without them, the remaining goblins can't stand against you, the kobolds, and the dragon without succumbing further to the Outcast . The oracles should record that the kobolds and their allies pushed out the Durbuluk Tribe in a few months under Durnn 's leadership though; not under mine.","title":"006-20200326"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/006-20200326/#006-20200326","text":"Info campaign:: SumonHo date:: 2022-09-25 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: Don Warnecke Last Session: 005-20200319 Info ^summary","title":"006-20200326"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/006-20200326/#session-log","text":"Quest: [[Search and Rescue - Powell]] Kereshi peeked into the room and saw 3 hobgoblins and a goblin , although she wasn\u2019t sure what the hobgoblins are.

She said if she was set free she could communicate it to her other warrior goblins on this level. The Durbuluk Tribe has worked with the Outcast more closely since Durnn\u2019s arrival. The party had talked about going down after the signet ring and armor, but also since they are here for the \u201ckids\u201d and one of them is down there with the Outcast . When looking down the well, Durnn \u2019s body was no longer visible. From Don: The time between sessions will be seconds for the characters, but I'd hate to have the players spend all week thinking about what to do next and then get a more concise version of things at the beginning of the session that throws their thoughts in a tailspin. So I am sending this out ahead of our next session although it makes it a narration instead of a dialog. Below is the information the goblin will relay at the beginning of the next session. Throughout the 'conversation,' Grenl would be looking at Eljas , who spoke of the agreement with the kobolds, and Fuzula , who spoke like she was concerned about the tribe's safety. When she mentions the dragon, she would glance at Kereshi . I will look out for the safety of my tribe. You don't understand the risk of looking for a new home; especially leaving one this nice which we have lived in for decades. The kobold threat is less than the risk out there. We can't just move into a house outside of your town, now can we? But I would rather face the uncertainty out there to our childern with my remaining warriors than to face the kobolds without my warriors. 1. If you are really willing to break your deal with the kobolds, I will spread the word that you have safe passage up here while you explore below. I will have gotten the word out in that time. The might of the goblins and kobolds can continue to work on each other for mastery of this citadel. You have weakened us a bunch, but I believe we can still overcome those dogs. I'm willing to give it a try. 2. If you are really willing to break your deal and do the right thing, we could work together to expell the kobolds. If your trick to control the dragon works as you think it does, getting rid of us only lets them have the keep with an immense power. Together, we could defeat them by encouraging a group of them to pursue my warriors and we destroy them. Then attacking them where they rest on their pompous throne. Maybe your trick can be used to destroy the dragon. 3. If you are actually intent on pushing us out so the newcomers can have our home, as I said we would sooner leave than have you kill our warriors one at a time. But it is not due to fear of the kobolds. If you are intent on freeing up the kobolds to settle into this keep, we will leave. Despite our differences, Durnn and the hobgoblins were mighty warriors. Without them, the remaining goblins can't stand against you, the kobolds, and the dragon without succumbing further to the Outcast . The oracles should record that the kobolds and their allies pushed out the Durbuluk Tribe in a few months under Durnn 's leadership though; not under mine.","title":"Session Log"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/007-20200402/","tags":["ttrpg/session/sumonho"],"text":"007-20200402 Info campaign:: SumonHo date:: 2022-09-25 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: Don Warnecke Last Session: 006-20200326 Info The party learns about capitalism.

Olseris put the finishing blow on the evil tree badly damaged by Elinor (and Eljas ) which freed another of the tree\u2019s \u201csupplicants.\u201d This rapier wielding man turned on Belak , presumably his former master. Without sufficient time to evaluate the effect of the damaged tree (or being able to see the full extent of that damage), Bronson \u201cdropped\u201d Sharwyn . He couldn\u2019t survive another blast like her last one. Bronson took her component pouch and disarmed her body, but couldn\u2019t figure out how to stop the bleeding on her changed physiology, not that he had any particular skill in this activity. In the heat of the moment, he forgot he had a healer\u2019s kit in his pack (I\u2019m not sure during what adventure he got this). Thanks to Elinor \u2019s efforts, Belak \u2019s former lackey dropped him. Then turned on Fuzula . Eljas beheaded Belak to take it with him. The party collected Braford\u2019s chain mail, shield, and magic sword ( Shatterspike ); Sharwyn \u2019s magic dagger, \u201cRobbie\u2019s\u201d rapier, crossbow, and leather armor; and Belak \u2019s Wand of Entangle.

Taking Sharwyn \u2019s body, they headed back above ground. Grenyl was disappointed the party destroyed the tree and made one half-hearted attempt to coax the party to take care of the kobolds to destroy the dragon. Then they left the \u201c Fortress Down Under .\u201d As the group climbed the stairs, the wind howled. They heard something eerie on the wind, but it was too hard to hear to tell what it was, or even to be sure if you really heard something. The party decided to go to the road and travel alongside it taking some cover. Fowlerville is 4 hours away. The party could see fine with the ambient light of the moon. About 30 minutes into the trip, a crimson light shone behind them. It was several thin lights from the ground into the clouds in the sky. After a few seconds, the thin columns of lights combined into one column. The group continued on to Fowlerville . The party was expecting to have to talk to a guard to learn where Vivian Powell lives. Eljas also planned to take Belak \u2019s head to the local [[guard]] and let them know about the goblins and kobolds, including the dragon wyrmling.

Without sufficient time to evaluate the effect of the damaged tree (or being able to see the full extent of that damage), Bronson \u201cdropped\u201d Sharwyn . He couldn\u2019t survive another blast like her last one.

Taking Sharwyn \u2019s body, they headed back above ground. Grenyl was disappointed the party destroyed the tree and made one half-hearted attempt to coax the party to take care of the kobolds to destroy the dragon. Then they left the \u201c Fortress Down Under .\u201d As the group climbed the stairs, the wind howled. They heard something eerie on the wind, but it was too hard to hear to tell what it was, or even to be sure if you really heard something. The party decided to go to the road and travel alongside it taking some cover. Fowlerville is 4 hours away. The party could see fine with the ambient light of the moon. About 30 minutes into the trip, a crimson light shone behind them. It was several thin lights from the ground into the clouds in the sky. After a few seconds, the thin columns of lights combined into one column. The group continued on to Fowlerville . The party was expecting to have to talk to a guard to learn where Vivian Powell lives. Eljas also planned to take Belak \u2019s head to the local [[guard]] and let them know about the goblins and kobolds, including the dragon wyrmling.","title":"Session Log"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/011-20200430/#treasure","text":"","title":"Treasure"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/011-20200430/#ttrpgtreasure-distribution-from-the-fortress-down-under-included","text":"132 gp to each party member Sir Braford \u2019s magic longsword ([[Magic Items#Shatterspike|Shatterspike]]) to Eljas Belak \u2019s [[Magic Items#Wand of Entangle]] went to Elinor Sharwyn \u2019s dagger +1 to Bronson the goblin\u2019s Static Shortbow to Fuzula . -The party also found 8 spell scrolls; six found/carried by Olseris and 2 found/carried by Bronson .

It included Joren , Drawr (who she called the Sage of Ironville ), Ajax , Travis , and others. She also mentioned a Sir Ryan who wasn't with them any longer and Oigah , the \"Ogre hero\" who led the Northern Army . A couple hours after meeting Christeria , Olseris spotted a flash of light about a mile away; like the glint of the sun off metal. Soon after that, the road passes through small rolling hills. As you round a bend in the road, you see a wagon along the side of the road about 200 feet ahead of you. The wagon has a single, thin draft horse attached to it. It appears to be broken down as a figure, hooded from the beating sun, stands next to the road leaning on the side of the wagon. It looks like a large man is kneeling to work with the brake-side wheel. Neither seems to have noticed you at the moment. Olseris made Fuzula invisible for her to scout ahead. Eljas , and others, got off the wagon about 120 feet away to see if he could help. It was an orc ambush. The 5 orcs, [[orc]] shaman, and orc barbarian didn't outnumber their quarry since the addition of Christeria . Although Christeria wasn't much of a fighter, her [[Spells B#Bless]] spell was helpful and her attack cantrip bypassed the barbarian's resistances to normal weapons. The barbarian had a shield representing the \" Tear Bringers \" clan from Kereshi 's past. The assailants had 5 poor quality greataxes, a greataxe, a spear, 10 poor quality javelins, 2 handaxes, 2 javelins, ring mail armor, a dented sheild, 5 hide armor, a Tear Bringers shield, 42 gp, 86 sp, and 2 azurite gemstones (10 gp each).

A couple hours after meeting Christeria , Olseris spotted a flash of light about a mile away; like the glint of the sun off metal. Soon after that, the road passes through small rolling hills. As you round a bend in the road, you see a wagon along the side of the road about 200 feet ahead of you. The wagon has a single, thin draft horse attached to it. It appears to be broken down as a figure, hooded from the beating sun, stands next to the road leaning on the side of the wagon. It looks like a large man is kneeling to work with the brake-side wheel. Neither seems to have noticed you at the moment. Olseris made Fuzula invisible for her to scout ahead. Eljas , and others, got off the wagon about 120 feet away to see if he could help. It was an orc ambush. The 5 orcs, [[orc]] shaman, and orc barbarian didn't outnumber their quarry since the addition of Christeria . Although Christeria wasn't much of a fighter, her [[Spells B#Bless]] spell was helpful and her attack cantrip bypassed the barbarian's resistances to normal weapons. The barbarian had a shield representing the \" Tear Bringers \" clan from Kereshi 's past. The assailants had 5 poor quality greataxes, a greataxe, a spear, 10 poor quality javelins, 2 handaxes, 2 javelins, ring mail armor, a dented sheild, 5 hide armor, a Tear Bringers shield, 42 gp, 86 sp, and 2 azurite gemstones (10 gp each).

Olseris found himself humming a tune that he's been hearing in his head unconciously since the orc fight. He's not sure that there's anything significant about the ditty itself, but it comes from the recesses of your mind that I tap into when I meditate on my patron. Over the next couple of days, Olseris seemed more chipper (or at least less withdrawn) than usual.\" The less somber, nearly cheerful, mood lasts 2-3 days. Although bloody and with some wear showing (i.e. wheel spoke), the wagon was servicable. After Eljas and Bronson prepared and buried the farmers from the ditch, Christeria asked a spirit to heal damage to their bodies. She also mentioned that she was selling a potion to \"give you strength equal to that of a brutish hill giant \u201d for 230 gp. Dinner was a bland food evoked by Christeria . When she heard mention of the Stone Tooth , she said \"Oh, I know where that is\". Over the next couple of days, Olseris seemed more chipper (or at least less withdrawn) than usual. They traveled on to Blessingburg . In Blessingburg , Olseris told the guard about the Tear Bringers orcs, sold the found wagon (10 gp), sold the captured armor and arms (93 gp), purchased some items including a pully & an 8' collapsable pole, and got basic directions to the Stone Tooth . Elinor sent Laider a letter asking if he knows how to reach Michael. She sent it via a local carrier named Antonio. After Eljas freshed up with an ale, they hit the road again; leaving Blessingburg around 3 pm. The next 24 hours were uneventful.

Heading down the fissure with stairs cut into it, the party wound their way into a large cavern with natural water flow. There are two tunnels leading out in addition to the water running under a low overhang. They headed left, following the tracks of barefooted humanoids. Finding the tunnel believed to have originally been created by the orc army to invade this place, defeating a trio of troglodytes, and freeing a bear, the party continued to explore. Kereshi tested one of the three mixtures he found on the orc shaman. When thrown, the alchemist\u2019s fire burned the wooden gate holding in the bear. They found a pair of ancient, moss covered dwarves. One had a beautiful long sword with Durgeddin \u2019s mark seemingly untouched by time. The other had a beautiful steel helmet chased with silver (worth 110 gp). Our heroes continued down the tunnel they were on.","title":"Session Log"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/021-20200804/","tags":["ttrpg/session/sumonho"],"text":"021-20200804 Info campaign:: SumonHo date:: 2022-09-25 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: Don Warnecke Last Session: 020-20200716 Info ^summary Session Log Quest: [[SLD - Retrieve Necromancers Bane]] Entering a massive cavern full of phosphorescent plants and a sparkling ceiling, the party saw a couple stairs and a door. They headed toward the door. Along the way, they were attacked by a pair of monstrous worms with tentacles centered by a beak. The two that ambushed them were killed, and at least one more was elsewhere in the room. Elinor picked the difficult lock on the door. At the door, the Divining Dagger began to glow faint blue light indicating it was within 300 feet of the Necomancers Bane . The Player Characters had enough experience to achieve 4th level, but needed a couple days of downtime to transform that experience into new capability. Fuzula scouted ahead on the other side of the door. Going up a set of steep stairs, they came to an octagonal room. The dust on the floor led them to a secret door instead of the trapped doors. The ringing of hammer on anvil could be heard. Walking half way up the 20\u2019 stairs, a \u2018magic mouth\u2019 spell called out in Dwarvish \u201cAlert! Alert! Intruders approach!\u201d each time someone passed. At the top of the stairs, a stone door carved with a glowering dwarf\u2019s face. Beyond that door, a hidden voice called out \u201cGo back the way you came! (in common) and \u201cThis is the only warning you\u2019ll get. Trespassing will not be forgiven!\u201d (in Draconic). As the party moved into the room, the hidden creature summoned 8 giant poisonous snakes. He, a [[lizardfolk shaman]], was supported by 2 lizardfolk and 4 kobolds. All but the undamaged shaman was killed. It was a long, tough slog of a fight. Elinor and Bronson were both brought to zero. Kereshi would have if it wasn\u2019t for her Relentless Endurance. With Bronson still unconscious and others at single digit hit points, three lizardfolk reinforcements showed up. Olseris blasted the first one in the line with an incredible eldritch blast. The other 2 primitive lizardfolk turned and ran back out of the room to regroup. The party, with Eljas carrying Bronson , also ran out to regroup. They headed down the steep stairs, over to and up the grand stairs, and through to outside. Olseris and Kereshi popped into the Great Ulfe\u2019s room. One of the two chests was missing. They took the other one with them. Within the chest, there are 380 gp, 30 sp, a dozen fine dishes (mostly broken), a potion of climbing, and a magnificent rapier. \u201cThe ogre would never stoop to wielding the delicate blade like some prancing bard.\u201d Leaving the front entrance of Khandrukar , they left the door open. If someone was to come along behind the party and bar it, they should be able to find the old orc tunnel to get back in. During the downtime, the party deduces that the two found potions that look similar are both healing potions. One was found on the [[Orog]] that dropped Kereshi and I think the other one was found in the orc bunkroom. Elinor uses detect magic to confirm that the rapier +1 (from Great Ulfe\u2019s room) and long sword +1 with Durgeddin \u2019s smith-mark (from fungus cavern) are both magical.

After ascending the stairs and passing through the secret door behind the statue, Kereshi and Eljas peered into the hall side-by-side.

A round later a [[lizardfolk shaman]], lizardman, and a more powerful lizardman (Lizardfolk Hunter) entered. The shaman conjured 8 constrictor snakes.

Luckily, the party didn\u2019t take any of their stuff. After the rest, the next time his head poked out they waved him to come talk. He gestured to wait. Twenty minutes later, 2 dwarves stepped just into the room.

The group becoming known as Danger Inc. headed right. After passing another secret door, they came to a ledge that overlooked a deep hole farther into the earth. A waterfall from the river that ran through the dwarven bladeworks was across the pit to the right. A chain ladder was at the edge of the ledge. Thanks to Olseris , an invisible Fuzula scouted below. Thirty foot below, she found a ledge with a small tunnel. It led 50\u2019 to a natural chamber with a pool of water, a constructed wall with reinforced door, an aged chair, and similar table. Fuzula returned to the chain ladder to take it 130\u2019 farther down. The crashing of water from the waterfall was deafening. The tracks down here and her Primeval Awareness told her that a dragon was indeed down here. She returned up top, collected the Divining Dagger , and climbed back down. Before she reached the bottom, the dagger indicated that she was now more than 100 feet from the Necomancers Bane . Returning to the small ledge, she went in. Before she reached the room with the pool, the dagger indicated she was within 30\u2019 of the fabled warhammer. Fuzula conferred with Danger Inc. and they assembled in the room with the pool. Through the unlocked door, they found 3 rooms with frescos. One room had a continually burning brazier and little else. One had three weapons on display racks. \u201cAll are of the highest quality and are engraved with Durgeddin \u2019s mark. To the left, a fine long sword. To the right, a beautiful battle axe. In the center, a magnificent war hammer.\u201d The third room had the device for which they searched. But it had a painful lock of 3 keys and a plunger. As they took their time trying to determine where the protective traps were, Eljas became impatient and opened the class case and took the Necomancers Bane (at this point, play triumphed music). He tucked it in the shoulder straps of his backpack. As the party left the \u201cHammer level,\u201d an invisible Fuzula headed up the ladder to leave with the prize. Eljas and Kereshi went down. Elinor reluctantly followed. Olseris joined them. Bronson , although letting some distance between them, relented. With several admonitions that \u201cthis is a bad idea,\u201d Fuzula was forced to go down to stick with the party. Cassiel, Bronson \u2019s familiar, went forward to check it out. Although visibility was hard through Cass\u2019s eyes, they confirmed the dragon was with his treasure. After some consideration, Elinor and Olseris had an idea. With their magic and gifts, they both appeared as lizardfolk and quietly made their way toward the treasure. As they neared the edge, still just over 60\u2019 away, the dragon slid off into the water. It\u2019s head rose out of the water 15\u2019 from the shore saying in common, \u201cYes.\u201d The fear was nearly overwhelming, but Elinor and Olseris kept their calm. It, however, was very difficult to think and Elinor struggled to spin a believable story on the spot. Olseris dropped his lizardfolk appearance, and summoned his pact weapon in the likeness of the Necomancers Bane . He claimed to have heard that the mighty dragon was down here and they brought the most fabulous weapon in exchange for letting them leave unharmed. The dragon seemed skeptical, but ultimately said that Olseris could lay down his tribute and leave in safety. Olseris and Elinor \u2019s retreat was slowed by a bridge collapsing under the weight of both of them. Danger Inc. rushed up the ladder. They had to hurry because the pact weapon would disappear 1 minute after it was more than 5 feet from Olseris . As they crossed the Glitterhame at a quick jog, the black dragon squeezed through a door to the south. They continued to rush toward their exit door. When the dragon saw they weren\u2019t following the path, it rushed forward. Eljas was separated a little as he was the least agile person of the group. The dragon landed by him as he ran. Eljas landed a hit with his spiritual weapon, but Toll the Dead was resisted. He persevered forward, but the dragon took a bite out of him as he ran for the door with the rest. As most of the party followed Eljas \u2019s request and continued on, two came back. Kereshi grabbed the Necomancers Bane from him so if his heroic efforts went badly the hammer wouldn\u2019t be lost. Olseris also came back, Suggested (spell) the dragon leave them alone, saw that his attempt was resisted, and positioned himself protectively behind Eljas . Eljas wouldn\u2019t be standing if he took another bite like that. Seeing the half-elf who tried to trick him, the dragon released a massive stream of acid at the two friends. Both of our heroes were dead within seconds after hitting the ground. The acid ate into their equipment and flesh. Fearful that they weren\u2019t catching up but more fearful that the dragon was still closing in, the party climbed to the Mountain Door. There, after Bronson reformed Cass as a hawk, they headed back to their basecamp where they rested and trained the days before. With great sadness, the party realized that their friends had fallen. Also disappointing, lost were 3 magic swords ([[Magic Items#Shatterspike]], a longsword +1, and a rapier +1), the Divining Dagger , and the funds set aside for the SLD . Worry creeps into their minds as they wonder if the dragon could know that the Divining Dagger could be used in a search for the party. After all, it would be glowing faint green right now. Making sure to stay hidden from a flying search, the group sets down for a somber night despite having retrieved their goal. But what a story they have to tell!","title":"023-20200820"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/023-20200820/#023-20200820","text":"Info campaign:: SumonHo date:: 2020-08-20 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: Don Warnecke Last Session: 022-20200816 Info ^summary","title":"023-20200820"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/023-20200820/#session-log","text":"Quest: [[SLD - Retrieve Necromancers Bane]] The secret door led 20\u2019 to a \u2018T\u2019 in the hall.

Fuzula returned to the chain ladder to take it 130\u2019 farther down. The crashing of water from the waterfall was deafening. The tracks down here and her Primeval Awareness told her that a dragon was indeed down here. She returned up top, collected the Divining Dagger , and climbed back down. Before she reached the bottom, the dagger indicated that she was now more than 100 feet from the Necomancers Bane . Returning to the small ledge, she went in. Before she reached the room with the pool, the dagger indicated she was within 30\u2019 of the fabled warhammer. Fuzula conferred with Danger Inc. and they assembled in the room with the pool. Through the unlocked door, they found 3 rooms with frescos. One room had a continually burning brazier and little else. One had three weapons on display racks. \u201cAll are of the highest quality and are engraved with Durgeddin \u2019s mark. To the left, a fine long sword. To the right, a beautiful battle axe. In the center, a magnificent war hammer.\u201d The third room had the device for which they searched. But it had a painful lock of 3 keys and a plunger. As they took their time trying to determine where the protective traps were, Eljas became impatient and opened the class case and took the Necomancers Bane (at this point, play triumphed music). He tucked it in the shoulder straps of his backpack. As the party left the \u201cHammer level,\u201d an invisible Fuzula headed up the ladder to leave with the prize. Eljas and Kereshi went down. Elinor reluctantly followed. Olseris joined them. Bronson , although letting some distance between them, relented. With several admonitions that \u201cthis is a bad idea,\u201d Fuzula was forced to go down to stick with the party. Cassiel, Bronson \u2019s familiar, went forward to check it out. Although visibility was hard through Cass\u2019s eyes, they confirmed the dragon was with his treasure. After some consideration, Elinor and Olseris had an idea. With their magic and gifts, they both appeared as lizardfolk and quietly made their way toward the treasure. As they neared the edge, still just over 60\u2019 away, the dragon slid off into the water. It\u2019s head rose out of the water 15\u2019 from the shore saying in common, \u201cYes.\u201d The fear was nearly overwhelming, but Elinor and Olseris kept their calm. It, however, was very difficult to think and Elinor struggled to spin a believable story on the spot. Olseris dropped his lizardfolk appearance, and summoned his pact weapon in the likeness of the Necomancers Bane . He claimed to have heard that the mighty dragon was down here and they brought the most fabulous weapon in exchange for letting them leave unharmed. The dragon seemed skeptical, but ultimately said that Olseris could lay down his tribute and leave in safety. Olseris and Elinor \u2019s retreat was slowed by a bridge collapsing under the weight of both of them. Danger Inc. rushed up the ladder. They had to hurry because the pact weapon would disappear 1 minute after it was more than 5 feet from Olseris . As they crossed the Glitterhame at a quick jog, the black dragon squeezed through a door to the south. They continued to rush toward their exit door. When the dragon saw they weren\u2019t following the path, it rushed forward. Eljas was separated a little as he was the least agile person of the group. The dragon landed by him as he ran. Eljas landed a hit with his spiritual weapon, but Toll the Dead was resisted. He persevered forward, but the dragon took a bite out of him as he ran for the door with the rest. As most of the party followed Eljas \u2019s request and continued on, two came back. Kereshi grabbed the Necomancers Bane from him so if his heroic efforts went badly the hammer wouldn\u2019t be lost. Olseris also came back, Suggested (spell) the dragon leave them alone, saw that his attempt was resisted, and positioned himself protectively behind Eljas . Eljas wouldn\u2019t be standing if he took another bite like that. Seeing the half-elf who tried to trick him, the dragon released a massive stream of acid at the two friends. Both of our heroes were dead within seconds after hitting the ground. The acid ate into their equipment and flesh. Fearful that they weren\u2019t catching up but more fearful that the dragon was still closing in, the party climbed to the Mountain Door. There, after Bronson reformed Cass as a hawk, they headed back to their basecamp where they rested and trained the days before. With great sadness, the party realized that their friends had fallen. Also disappointing, lost were 3 magic swords ([[Magic Items#Shatterspike]], a longsword +1, and a rapier +1), the Divining Dagger , and the funds set aside for the SLD . Worry creeps into their minds as they wonder if the dragon could know that the Divining Dagger could be used in a search for the party. After all, it would be glowing faint green right now. Making sure to stay hidden from a flying search, the group sets down for a somber night despite having retrieved their goal. But what a story they have to tell!","title":"Session Log"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/024-20200910/","tags":["ttrpg/session/sumonho"],"text":"024-20200910 Info campaign:: SumonHo date:: 2020-09-10 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: Don Warnecke Last Session: 023-20200820 Info ^summary Session Log Quest: [[SLD - Retrieve Necromancers Bane]] The party settled down for the night with Elinor taking first watch. The black dragon, referred to as Dark Might by the dwarves, showed up in the camp with the Divining Dagger . Elinor used word acrobatics to avoid telling him what the magic dagger did.

After \u201cconvincing\u201d the dragon she was not privy to the plan of the \u201cevil trickster,\u201d Elinor joined Fuzula and Kereshi with a status of \u201cnot on my list\u201d to hunt down and destroy.

The travel was a miserable trip with heavy rain for most of the 2 days. During the trip, Averos used Sending to reach out to Fuzula with Eljas not responding. Three days later, Eljas had told him they planned to make a second push into the stronghold. Averos said he could be at the Dancing Drake in 4 days. Ultimately, the party communicated they had the Necomancers Bane and could meet Averos at the Dancing Drake . He ended the first message with, \u201cYou can respond in 25 words.\u201d Fuzula responded to both messages with a simple and accurate, \u201cYes\u2026\u201d The Power behind the Alter communicated with three members of the party for 1 minute. It asked them to \u201cinvestigate the disappearance\u201d of one of its beloved archers, Freddie , who was himself in Blessingburg investigating the use of Penetration Stone . The party has 2 days to figure it out without impacting their timeline to meet Averos . Elinor joined a game of dice with a pair of farmhands for 1 roll. Kereshi and Elinor , separately, met the young men who were sent by Laidor to deliver his response to Elinor . After receiving the message, Elinor was told they are leaving for Aimesville in the morning if she has a response. Kereshi went over to meet the man in splint mail, Sigmund , who was also watching the motley crew of a party after they walked in. Sigmund had met Freddie the night before but hadn\u2019t seen him all day. Sigmund mentioned that Freddie had the same violent tint to his fingernails that Kereshi does. The cleric of Diancecht joined the party at their table. Sigmund mentioned that Freddie kept a journal or notebook of some kind. When the bartender wouldn\u2019t open Freddie \u2019s room until he was unaccounted for a few days despite the help the night before, Elinor picked the lock to his room. Elinor found Freddie \u2019s notes under his bedding material. It was about 40 pages long and the last day\u2019s entries said he was headed to the \u201cApplegales,\u201d a farm 45 minutes outside of town, \u201cTonight.\u201d Damage Incorporated and Sigmund waited until dark to head for the farm. At approximately 10 pm, they rendezvoused outside of the Griffin\u2019s Nest to head out of town. Bronson left Judgement in the stables. At the Applegales Farm, the house and main barn had a large back field and smaller side fields on each side. Even the side fields were still over 100 feet wide. Woods surrounded the fields. Fuzula , with some later help from Bronson , investigated the barn. There were 3 wagons in it that didn\u2019t seem like they were part of the farm\u2019s normal equipment, but no people were visible. The tracks of over a dozen people led through the back woods. Following the trail, the party passed along a few other fields over almost an hour\u2019s trek. At the end, they reached a long abandoned wagon trail, an empty shed that had some blood in it, and a crevice caused by what looks like a collapsed mine. The sound of a wind instrument or eerie intone could be heard on the wind. Down in the ravine a large, tan tent has been erected, roughly 15ft by 25ft. It is difficult to see much more through the darkness, foliage and rocks. Based on the limited shadows, you can tell there is at least one figure on the north side and several are on the south side, maybe as many as a dozen. The chanting is coming from that area and a soft, dull red or crimson light escapes from under the tent. Bronson reminds the party what he saw at the first [[Binding Site]] when he went with the Seina to investigate the Crimson Column of light many had seen shooting up into the air.

This accomplishment gives us a great start to piercing the veil between our world and the restless place of the forsaken souls of the people. It is the will of the 3 true gods to return these souls to their eternal right to inhabit this land. You have clearly set yourself apart as one of the bravest and most creative of our Brotherhood. You have clearly demonstrated your ingenuity and I am forever grateful. After establishing the 2nd [[Binding Site]], you shall meet with the acquisition team in Aimesville at the normal place. They are to acquire a Penetration Stone from the cellar of the Everson Estate locally. The owner is not expected to be cooperative. When they have it, they should deliver it to Disciple Kenton . There are also 2 Penetration Stone to be acquired in the Ravaged Lands . They are in the possession of the shaman of the Tear Bringer orc tribe and the master of the Passion Place . Delivery instructions for these stones will be given to the team upon delivery of the Aimesville stone. There are three other Penetration Stone they should prepare to conquest. They are near the Demon\u2019s Door so they will be extremely dangerous missions. But make them aware that this will be their responsibility when the time comes. I personally thank you for your service. It will be an amazing accomplishment to have 2 binding sites established. A third may allow some benefit if it can be created with the power of at least 30 souls. And you\u2019re contribution has been of great worth.

In exchange for retrieving the Necomancers Bane from Khandrukar , the four surviving members of Danger Inc. received 3,000 gp worth of coins and gems. All four party members got 728 gp worth. Due to having many loose ends they still have to follow-up on and the loss of close friends, Danger Inc. will not take another mission right now.

The party would get an early start in the morning which should allow them to arrive in Aimesville in 3 long days of travel. A platoon of soldiers with a caravan shortly behind it would be safer but take too long to arrive. About 5 miles outside of town, Elinor used her disguise kit and Disciple Antwon \u2019s clothes/armor to appear as him. At opportune times, she also used the Disguise Self spell. The group will meet in the Home Comfort Inn . Elinor expects Laidor to be in the Fizzy Naval Bar and Tavern for dinner tomorrow night. He is usually there 2 days a week. With amazing insight, Elinor found a waiter that seemed to recognize her. He referred to her as \u201cBrother.\u201d Although confused why she was asking, he said the next meeting was in three days behind the Dirty Kitten . He showed her some deferential treatment and also reminded her not to forget her \u201ccard.\u201d ( Brotherhood ID Card ) Elinor and Fuzula returned to the restaurant and followed him to a one room home on the poor side of town. It looked like multiple people lived there. They plan to enter his home when he goes to work the next day. Kereshi is looking for a bar fight. We\u2019ll see how that turns out next week.

About 5 miles outside of town, Elinor used her disguise kit and Disciple Antwon \u2019s clothes/armor to appear as him. At opportune times, she also used the Disguise Self spell. The group will meet in the Home Comfort Inn . Elinor expects Laidor to be in the Fizzy Naval Bar and Tavern for dinner tomorrow night. He is usually there 2 days a week. With amazing insight, Elinor found a waiter that seemed to recognize her. He referred to her as \u201cBrother.\u201d Although confused why she was asking, he said the next meeting was in three days behind the Dirty Kitten . He showed her some deferential treatment and also reminded her not to forget her \u201ccard.\u201d ( Brotherhood ID Card ) Elinor and Fuzula returned to the restaurant and followed him to a one room home on the poor side of town. It looked like multiple people lived there. They plan to enter his home when he goes to work the next day. Kereshi is looking for a bar fight. We\u2019ll see how that turns out next week. Bronson , Sigmund , and Freddie found the Everson Estate in the upper middle-class neighborhood, large but old. The guard seemed to close down his post at 1 am.","title":"Session Log"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/026-20200925/#treasure","text":"","title":"Treasure"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/026-20200925/#ttrpgtreasure-3000-gp-worth-of-coins-and-gems-all-four-party-members-got-728-gp-worth","text":"","title":"ttrpg/treasure 3,000 gp worth of coins and gems.

Carter Everson thanked them and they parted ways with the stone. Booster /Lem awaited them at the inn. Booster forged a letter very similar to the real one from The Prophet (to Disciple Antwon ) except it claimed the next Penetration Stone was in the mountains north of Blessingburg in a place called the Stone Tooth ; the next two were in one of the old dwarven fortresses in the mountains across the Ravaged Lands and in the Fortress Down Under ; and the last three were somewhere in the Northern Frontier .

The next morning, Freddie caught up with his associate and brought her back to the Home Comfort Inn . She is a tiefling Physic Investigator that goes by the name Hopeful . The party decided to travel to the prime material plane home of Hun-Hoksa to entrust the Penetration Stone with her. The place is called the Mountain Sanctum (although the DM didn\u2019t share this with you, Freddie and Hopeful would have). First, Sigmund said goodbye to Mom. She gave him an apple pie and said she would mention to their superiors the idea of his involvement in representing the church in rebuilding Placidburg.

Booster identified Disciple Antwon \u2019s leather armor (Resistance to Necrotic) and didn\u2019t let his sister leave without delivering the Bag of Holding.

The march, although not \u201cdifficult terrain\u201d with Freddie \u2019s expertise, was grueling work. Elinor was very exhausted. Fuzula , Sigmund , and Freddie were exhausted.

Faint magic permeated the area. That night, no one slept well. Fuzula had terrible nightmares preventing her from getting much rest, even taking 6 points of psychic damage that reduced her maximum hit points. The party set out late morning to head back to Aimesland . A few hundred feet from your campsite, you met Auntie Caustic (aka Caus ). She is a middle-aged female hafling in dirty traveling clothes and studded leather armor. She has dark yellow bracers on her wrists and a circlet of dull yellow metal. At her waist band under her cloak, a short sword and dagger are sheathed. A scar runs from her left temple down to her jaw line, an apparent souvenir of a very close call. The party seems to consider Caus somewhere between eccentric and insane. Sigmund has some doubt about the stories she spins and her intentions; admittedly \u201cinsane\u201d people are hard to read. For example the whole Halfling, sister to the half-elf Gerald, is not impossible but implausible. Of course, in one night making 6 days travel and stealing a magical artifact from an entire orc tribe without a fight is not impossible but implausible. [[[[Damage Inc.]] .]] came to a line of meadow 200 feet across. Northwest to southeast, it is miles in both directions. This flowery grasslands probably serves as a natural conduit for water in the rainy season. They crossed it directly and wasted no time. In the meadow is where the party finally conceded to let Auntie Caustic walk with them instead of following behind them. Just on the other side of the meadow, the party encountered 7 Gnolls trailed by 8 hyenas. The party defeated them. Ten gnolls in a column were encountered and defeated. Kereshi found 7 gp, 22 sp, 10 simple spears, 10 rough wooden shields, and 2 low-quality longbows. A single tribesman was encountered at 100 feet. He slid back into the woods when spotted. You suspect he was not alone, but neither group engaged the other. There was an encounter with 2 giant boars and 2 boars (that we didn\u2019t play through the details). As the sun has just dropped below the horizon, the party is just entering the part of the Ravaged Lands roughly cleared by the Aimesland military. You are about 90 minutes from the Dancing Drake .

Faint magic permeated the area. That night, no one slept well. Fuzula had terrible nightmares preventing her from getting much rest, even taking 6 points of psychic damage that reduced her maximum hit points. The party set out late morning to head back to Aimesland . A few hundred feet from your campsite, you met Auntie Caustic (aka Caus ). She is a middle-aged female hafling in dirty traveling clothes and studded leather armor. She has dark yellow bracers on her wrists and a circlet of dull yellow metal. At her waist band under her cloak, a short sword and dagger are sheathed. A scar runs from her left temple down to her jaw line, an apparent souvenir of a very close call. The party seems to consider Caus somewhere between eccentric and insane. Sigmund has some doubt about the stories she spins and her intentions; admittedly \u201cinsane\u201d people are hard to read. For example the whole Halfling, sister to the half-elf Gerald, is not impossible but implausible. Of course, in one night making 6 days travel and stealing a magical artifact from an entire orc tribe without a fight is not impossible but implausible. [[[[Damage Inc.]] .]] came to a line of meadow 200 feet across. Northwest to southeast, it is miles in both directions. This flowery grasslands probably serves as a natural conduit for water in the rainy season. They crossed it directly and wasted no time. In the meadow is where the party finally conceded to let Auntie Caustic walk with them instead of following behind them. Just on the other side of the meadow, the party encountered 7 Gnolls trailed by 8 hyenas. The party defeated them. Ten gnolls in a column were encountered and defeated. Kereshi found 7 gp, 22 sp, 10 simple spears, 10 rough wooden shields, and 2 low-quality longbows. A single tribesman was encountered at 100 feet. He slid back into the woods when spotted. You suspect he was not alone, but neither group engaged the other. There was an encounter with 2 giant boars and 2 boars (that we didn\u2019t play through the details). As the sun has just dropped below the horizon, the party is just entering the part of the Ravaged Lands roughly cleared by the Aimesland military. You are about 90 minutes from the Dancing Drake .

The party members were mostly honest in their registration. The story that they didn\u2019t register because they missed the line was hard to believe but told convincingly. The soldier was required to get a superior in this case. With the soldier\u2019s belief of their story (at Elinor \u2019s telling), \u201c Sigmund \u2019s\u201d offer/ability to help heal, and even Kereshi \u2019s repair of the roof, the Captain passed them through with little wait. Danger Inc. traveled to the Dancing Drake Inn. Auntie Caustic bypassed the fort and camped outside the Dancing Drake Inn\u2019s short wall. Sigmund got a haircut. Fuzula grabbed the biggest room so the party could talk. Gwyn Hovey revealed his real name and that he had been misleading in order to determine the party\u2019s true intentions with respect to the growing evil in the land. The party decided to head to Aimesville in the morning and seek training. Fuzula had another damaging sleep which reduced her maximum hp by 7 points. Fuzula verified with Primeval Awareness that fey and fiend creatures were within a mile. The party purchased a pair of horses to pull a new wagon, considering options to make the three+ day trip into as short of time as possible. The group collected Caus ( Auntie Caustic ) and headed east for Aimesville . Hearing of Fuzula \u2019s continued plight, Caus let her borrow her circlet but 1) confirmed they had a mutual enemy in the devilish Master at Lower Ecstasy and 2) insisted it must be returned before they separate. The next night, Fuzula didn\u2019t necessarily sleep well but she did not suffer damaging nightmares. After they had traveled a bit the next morning, Fuzula verified with Primeval Awareness that a was still nearby; that it was following them. Gwyn Hovey used Detect Good/Evil and determined Caus was the fiend. He shared this information with the party. Elinor made Caus , Gwyn Hovey , and Kereshi be honest with Zone of Truth. She confirmed that Caus was a fiend (blame her parents), did really know where Lower Ecstasy is located, did oppose the Master there, and believed as long as Fuzula wore her circlet that Fuzula wouldn\u2019t be harmed again. Irritating so, Caus said her presence caused Fuzula \u2019s nightmare pains but she wouldn\u2019t confirm that she actively or purposely did it. Most believed this omission, paired with her failure to state she was not the cause, simply meant it was her and she refused to admit it. Caus seemed to continue to try to keep the common ground since they have a shared enemy in the Master who possesses the next Penetration Stone . A few hours from Aimesville the party was stopped by Seina soldiers. They had reports of a crew of half a dozen people, including a tiefling and half-orc, robbing communities west of Aimesville . After determining they didn\u2019t have any of the missing items the officer apologized for the inconvenience and let them be on their way. The party, with Caus , continued on to Aimesville . Caus would not enter Aimesville , but the party knows where to find her. Thus far Fuzula hasn\u2019t had any more painful nightmares but also hasn\u2019t recovered her max-hp reduction. Once in Aimesville , Fuzula looked up Laidor to ask about Auntie Caustic and Gwyn Hovey . Laidor didn\u2019t know anything like Auntie Caustic , but wouldn\u2019t trust a fiend if she can help it. He would let her know if he heard anything. As far as Gwyn Hovey , Laidor said he knew Sigmund by reputation and he is \u201cone of the good guys.\u201d Fuzula sought out her brother Lem (aka Booster ). He identified the circlet as non-magical. It was a simple brass ornamental device. Fuzula only shared this fact with Kereshi .

As Kereshi was preparing to lower Fuzula into the hole, the whole group started whispering about their next steps. The passageway gave out under the weight causing the party to slide down into a large hall. The cave in locked Danger Inc. in the hall, surrounded by a noxious gas that makes their throats scratchy, keeps them coughing, and a grey/amber haze lightly obscures the area. As the group tried to figure out a way through the door, Hopeful summoned a spider familiar to scout down the hall under the door and Gwyn Hovey established a Tiny Hut. Kereshi knocked the door off its hinges with his sledge hammer; causing it to fall on him. Hopeful scouted with her spider. She detected a trap and snuck around a door, finding a [[giant crayfish]]. Hopeful temporarily dismissed the familiar. As the party moved out, Hopeful tried to disable the trap the spider had found. Her piton didn\u2019t hold and it set off the trap. Luckily, they were close enough together to not be separated by the trap. They passed through the double doors into a room with slippery mud and the [[giant crayfish]].

Finding this hallway to be a dead end, the party passed back through the hermit crab\u2019s Roost of the Conch. Passing through a room of deeper mud and overturned pedestals, they followed a hallway where a steady stream of water trickled down the hall. A 12\u2019 tall statue in the hall held a tray, had gems for eyes, and Elinor knew its sword was magical. As Caus began to climb the statue, Kereshi grabbed the halfling in her mighty grasp. Caus disappeared. Kereshi knew she wasn\u2019t just invisible because she no longer had the Caus in her grasp. Kereshi assumed she had teleported away, but Gwyn \u2019s remaining See Invisibility spell detected Caus in the Ethereal Plane. With Caus gone, Kereshi began climbing for the sword. She left the eyes, but her weight on the tray tipped the statue. The tipping of the statue revealed a secret tunnel (or with a banjo: SECRET TUNNEL, YEAH). Fuzula scouted ahead. Approximately 100\u2019 and one bend later the party exited a disengaged secret door. While a wet tunnel went to the east, Danger Inc. crossed to the door and went through.

Non-magic items included: a diadem of dark opals and jade discs breastplate of jade and bone (protects like studded leather,) over 100 beads (1 gp each) a jade cube bead a large agate gem and a mother-of-pearl in a clay container. Finding this hallway to be a dead end, the party passed back through the hermit crab\u2019s Roost of the Conch. Passing through a room of deeper mud and overturned pedestals, they followed a hallway where a steady stream of water trickled down the hall. A 12\u2019 tall statue in the hall held a tray, had gems for eyes, and Elinor knew its sword was magical. As Caus began to climb the statue, Kereshi grabbed the halfling in her mighty grasp. Caus disappeared. Kereshi knew she wasn\u2019t just invisible because she no longer had the Caus in her grasp. Kereshi assumed she had teleported away, but Gwyn \u2019s remaining See Invisibility spell detected Caus in the Ethereal Plane. With Caus gone, Kereshi began climbing for the sword. She left the eyes, but her weight on the tray tipped the statue. The tipping of the statue revealed a secret tunnel (or with a banjo: SECRET TUNNEL, YEAH). Fuzula scouted ahead. Approximately 100\u2019 and one bend later the party exited a disengaged secret door. While a wet tunnel went to the east, Danger Inc. crossed to the door and went through. The stairs behind the door led into a flooded room. I believe the detected magic items reside here. Please let me know if this is wrong. Kereshi carries the handaxe. The pendant, bracelets, potion, elixir, and statue's long sword are in the bag of holding. The rings are in the possession of, but not worn by, Caus and Gwyn . Elinor carries the mask in her pack.

Caus rejoined the party. Kereshi put on Tloques-Popolocas \u2019s bracelets. The door was swelled shut, so Kereshi came to assist. When it opened, the room emptied taking Kereshi , Elinor , and Hopeful with it. All three were able to get a grip on a corner or doorway. The hallway led to another flooded room with a dark, foul water covering the floor. Gwyn Hovey fell into a deep spot unable to catch himself on the slippery floor. Kereshi jumped in to help him out since his heavy armor interfered with swimming. Elinor also assisted with a crowbar and rope provided by Fuzula . A monstrous, intelligent snail called the room its home. It tried to verbally engage the party but they couldn\u2019t understand it. It \u2018explored\u2019 Kereshi \u2019s shoulder with its mouth (it lacks hands or paws). They head butted each other a couple of times. (Interestingly, the snail was nearly twice as intelligent as Kereshi ). When it couldn\u2019t talk to them but they were spending time hanging out in its hall, it pushed Elinor who responded to the impact with a sharp, magic-imbued retort. Not waiting around to see how the exchange went, Fuzula did what she does best\u2026she lit the snail up with her bow. Amazingly, other than some trouble moving to the steps, the party didn\u2019t have any trouble fighting on the very slippery floor. It spewed a large chunk of mucus at the group, hitting Elinor , Caus , and Fuzula . The water slowly rots their clothes, but this acidic phlegm burns the skin. The party had worn it down and it couldn\u2019t communicate with them, so it tried to run. In melee with Gwyn Hovey , Elinor , and Kereshi , all three took the opportunity to land blows. It was cut down by the collective force. Leaving the hall, they found the secret tunnel again. [Ahem, I\u2019ll refrain] Traversing it, they returned to the unexplored hallway. The hallway ended at a door. A sound could be heard that may be singing or echoing water. Opening the door, Gwyn Hovey heard a shriek and a splash. Whatever it may have been, it was gone by the time the door opened. The room was half filled with water. Just about everything in the room shone like soft moonlight. But no creature could be seen in the clear water (although the gas still obscured vision). Gwyn Hovey and Kereshi hurried up to the water, cautiously followed by the rest. Gwyn Hovey and Kereshi discussed Kereshi \u2019s treatment of Caus . As the party collected on the shoreline, a swimmer in the water giggled. She also spoke the foreign language and had an alien beauty about her. Largely ignoring her, the party followed the ledge Gwyn Hovey found around to the door. Another extremely slippery floor was traversed. The water from the previous room and this hallway was clean and potable. Waterskins were filled and Auntie rinsed her whole body and clothing. Others like Elinor rinsed their face. Danger Inc. entered a Great Hall, well over 100 feet long and 20 feet wide. Frescos line the walls and a tunnel, or so it appeared, led out the other side beyond an archway. The south wall\u2019s frescos were a depiction of a great battle. The north wall depicts the quest for a new land. Near the center shows a pyramid with a temple atop it. The sun shines brightly (figuratively) above the temple. As the party exited under the archway, Gwyn Hovey walked into a wall just beyond. The \u201ccontinuing\u201d hallway was actually a masterfully painted scene. As they searched for a way forward, a plate in the floor caused bars to drop from the archway, trapping Kereshi and Gwyn Hovey in the small room. The party went about searching\u2026 Gwyn Hovey continued to search for a way out Kereshi used his maul to see if he could break through the wall, causing much paint to collapse Hopeful searched for a button or switch, to no avail Fuzula looked around the broader room for anything they missed (Brandi, I think this was it) Elinor checked out the paintings for clues or signs (Stephanie,I also not sure I remembered right) Fuzula and Elinor both realized the portion of the work that depicts a sun was separate from the rest of the wall and slightly inset.

The 3 giant snakes were generally aggressive toward the party but not interested in pursuing them while digesting a recent meal of baboons. Thanks to Hopeful 's use of thaumaturgy, there was enough distance between the groups to keep their distance. A couple hours later, Danger Inc. encountered seven monstrosities that Hopeful referred to as \" Heart Eaters \". She said it is a terrifying fate to be overpowered by one. A well, placed Enemies Abound spell by Elinor kept some of the fight away from the party. Kereshi used his ring of jumping to leap up onto one of the monsters. He struck critically with the Soul Striker to devastating effect. While the vicious [[peryton]] (their technical name) barely made it to the party, their own critical hit during a diving attack brought Fuzula 'within an inch' of losing her life (or at least her consciousness). Hopeful was pretty beat up as well. Following the encounter, the party took a long rest on a wide point in the path calling it an early night. During the rest, Kereshi attuned to the weapon known as Soul Striker . Danger Inc. were back on the move around 2 or 3 am. The bright moon was sufficient to provide dim light for Elinor this evening. As the sun came up, Gwyn saw a dozen or so humanoids, likely humans, walk in a huge valley below them accompanied by 2 giant snakes. They had colorful clothes and walked alertly armed with long-spears, swords, and short bows. The party ignored them and pressed on west along the trail. Fuzula and Kereshi determined by the landscape that the party is just inside the Barrier Mountains north of Aimesland . The party strongly considered turning south and climbing the mountains at Kereshi 's urging. Ultimately, the task was decided to be too daunting. They would keep an eye out for a spot that may be reasonable. Several hours later the party stumbled upon two wyverns amongst the local goats. She knew them to be aggressive, powerful creatures but unlikely to fight to the death unless starving. Fuzula fired upon them before they took the opportunity to close for an attack.

The 3 giant snakes were generally aggressive toward the party but not interested in pursuing them while digesting a recent meal of baboons. Thanks to Hopeful 's use of thaumaturgy, there was enough distance between the groups to keep their distance. A couple hours later, Danger Inc. encountered seven monstrosities that Hopeful referred to as \" Heart Eaters \". She said it is a terrifying fate to be overpowered by one. A well, placed Enemies Abound spell by Elinor kept some of the fight away from the party. Kereshi used his ring of jumping to leap up onto one of the monsters. He struck critically with the Soul Striker to devastating effect. While the vicious [[peryton]] (their technical name) barely made it to the party, their own critical hit during a diving attack brought Fuzula 'within an inch' of losing her life (or at least her consciousness). Hopeful was pretty beat up as well. Following the encounter, the party took a long rest on a wide point in the path calling it an early night. During the rest, Kereshi attuned to the weapon known as Soul Striker . Danger Inc. were back on the move around 2 or 3 am. The bright moon was sufficient to provide dim light for Elinor this evening. As the sun came up, Gwyn saw a dozen or so humanoids, likely humans, walk in a huge valley below them accompanied by 2 giant snakes. They had colorful clothes and walked alertly armed with long-spears, swords, and short bows. The party ignored them and pressed on west along the trail. Fuzula and Kereshi determined by the landscape that the party is just inside the Barrier Mountains north of Aimesland . The party strongly considered turning south and climbing the mountains at Kereshi 's urging. Ultimately, the task was decided to be too daunting. They would keep an eye out for a spot that may be reasonable. Several hours later the party stumbled upon two wyverns amongst the local goats. She knew them to be aggressive, powerful creatures but unlikely to fight to the death unless starving. Fuzula fired upon them before they took the opportunity to close for an attack. In a short but hard fight, half the party was severely injured. One tried to grab Caus , the halfling, to take her with it in its retreat.

He said, \" Elinor , wishing you all well. Are you searching for the ' Eternal Artifacts ?' Need a partner or should I reach out in 4 months?\" Elinor said they were looking for the [[artifacts]], to establish the party wouldn't be looking for them 'for SLD ' if they partnered on the effort. Elinor asked if he might be at the Dancing Drake Inn, as that is where she was headed. He said that he was only a day south of the inn, but he couldn't go up there for a week. They were welcome to join him if they were able and wanted to talk. He was at Rogers Farm . They cut the corner and headed straight toward the road about a day south of the inn. Checking in a nearby town, they learned Rogers Farm was owned by Will Rogers, a description of it, and that it was a mile north of the town. Rogers Farm : It is a farm house with 2 barns, one particularly large and one relatively small. The stalls in the smaller barn hold 6 draft horses and 2 riding horses. SLD has a 10x20' room in the hay loft of the smaller barn. It has shelves of books, manuals, and papers behind a work desk. A table seats 8 people. The other barn houses cows and lamas. In a meadow is a small flock of sheep and a donkey; with a small three-walled shelter. Upon arriving, Danger Inc. went straight to the smaller barn. Kereshi knocked, waiting half a minute, then opened the door. Erika , a member of the security detail normally assigned to Averos , was approaching the door. Erika showed them to the room upstairs. Averos welcomed them. Below was part of the interaction. In conversation, he mentioned he was bored but didn't state his business here. Averos confirmed they were aware of the rough location of 3 of the 4 Eternal Artifacts . The mace \"is\" north of central Aimesland in the mountains. The robe is in a location that cannot be traveled to by land. Magic would allow them to get close enough that he could direct them where they had to go (but not \"in which room\"). Another item was near the Demon's Door , which is due west from their current location. There is a fourth item of unknown location. Averos finally understood that they were generally looking for the artifacts, but not searching for a specific one. Danger Inc. gave him information about the cult. The intention was to gain favor by providing valuable information. They hoped to learn about what they faced in the Passion Place in return. They don't know the cults name. The party didn't say anything about locations, neither Aimesville nor the Dirty Kitten . A ritual allows them to use the Penetration Stone to turn people into \"zombies.\" Afterward, the stone cannot be moved. They said they don't know anything about the ritual itself. They have recovered 2 stones ( Averos thinks the party carries both). Kereshi took it out of his pack with his bare hands to show Averos . Averos asked if he could touch it too. With permission he felt it, including the temperature and the smoothness. Only briefly, but Averos read part of the letter referencing the locations of the Penetration Stone . Averos was permitted to pen a copy of Disciple Yarman 's letter. He was allowed to keep a copy of the membership card. He was not told what the block at the top was for (it was for a name). Averos was showed Disciple Yarman 's letter and the membership card. Averos said he was not familiar with the symbol on the membership card. Averos was also asked if the pairs of characters meant anything to him. (The conversation went on before he answered. Since I'm not sure if it was an in-game or out-of-game distraction, I'll tell you what he would have answered.) He said that he didn't know what they said, but he thought it was #ttrpg/language/Abyssal. He can speak/read several languages, 7 in fact, but #ttrpg/language/Abyssal isn't one of them. In talking about the cult, Gwyn said to Elinor \"Don't you have a letter?\" Thinking of different letters, Elinor handed Averos the letter about the Penetration Stone instead of Disciple Yarman 's letter. Kereshi , not wanting to share that information, agitatedly stormed up to the desk and snatched the letter out of his hands. Erika tensed at the aggressive and disrespectful act. Elinor deftly switched out the original membership card for the forged one. She was certain Averos was sufficiently distracted. She wasn't sure if Erika saw, but Elinor had made an excellent performance. They headed out; heading south. After a couple hours on the road, they encountered a [[Displacer Beast]]. It turned out to be an ambush by dark clad humans; 4 men and a woman. One of the men was a spellcaster and the rest were warriors. Early in the fight, all of the party members felt a chill go down their spine and thought they heard the sound of a stone lid being pushed off of a sarcophagus.

The party defeated most of the assailants. In the fight, the caster was put to sleep. The 4 veteran warriors and a [[displacer beast]] were killed. A second [[displacer beast]] was dragging the sleeping caster away with its tentacles for a tasty meal when the party noticed it. The party damaged the last beast and it left its meal, although the caster had died from the [[displacer beast]]'s munching. Having sustained damage and used spell slots on a battle that nearly dropped one of the party, Danger Inc. decided to camp for the night. They did travel 1 hour further to put some distance between them and the escaped [[displacer beast]]. The party found 120 gp, 25 sp, and a divine spell scroll of Dark Ball (see ice knife spell except necrotic instead of cold damage). His emblem, appearing to be similar to a holy symbol, was a crouching wolf. It looked similar to the alter found when the party exited the shrine\u2026and encountered the 'floating armor.' See this passage from Session 39: The next day of travel was uneventful. The following day, shortly after noon, the party heard the sounds of combat over a small hill. Sneaking forward, Fuzula saw the disturbing view of a battle between Aimesland Seina and an orc raiding party. While the formation of 7 remaining soldiers fought the 5 orcs still attacking them, another orc sadistically continued to pound on a soldier named Ikky Arrosand . A prone Ikky had lost his right hand already and did his best to ward off the orc's repeated bone-jarring blows. The formation could not hope to make it to their downed companion without sacrificing the group. The party all climbed into the wagon and raced over the crest and down the hill. Fuzula jumped from the passenger seat and dropped 2 orcs with her first 3 arrows. Soon only one soldier-damaged orc remained, but that didn't last long. Kereshi was brutal, cutting off an orc head and throwing it at a comrade in an effort to intimidate. Sergeant Milfred and the [[dragonborn]] who formed the center of the soldiers' line, named Kanxaan , approached Kereshi who had been fighting near them. Elinor also moved up to join the conversation. Sergeant Milfred mentioned how lucky they were that the party had shown up. He explicitly thanked Fuzula , who had killed the orc mutilating Ikky. He then went about directing the troops. Burning the orcs. Tending to his wounded. Staging his dead, including his lieutenant. She had died in the battle. With a heavy heart, he told his remaining men and women \"We shall mourn later. Now, we must ensure our wits are with us for the rest of the patrol. Morning will be done within the walls of the fort.\" Kereshi found 7 gp and 37 sp among the orcs. The soldiers did not interfere with the looting. Kereshi jotted down the symbol of the orcs, which she didn't recognize (it wasn't a major clan or tribe). After spending a bit of time with the soldiers, the party prepared to leave. The sergeant said he didn't need any additional help, as they had already helped more than enough. As they left, he thanked them again and asked what the party is known as. Elinor said \" Danger Inc. .\" At the next evening while they were looking for a suitable campsite, Elinor was contacted by Averos . Averos said over 3 messages: after many, many hours of research the only reference to the Passion Place was an area bandit lieutenant's letter written 15 years ago. According to the letter, it's Master is a very powerful entity; a Battle Mage , a warrior spell caster. The letter references a password (opps, passphrase) to allow passage by the place's guards.

They would take the wilderness route to the Passion Place to limit their time in the Ravaged Lands . This means they will want to sell their wagon somewhere. The next morning they continued on their southern trek. At 2 pm on the 7th, the party arrived at Thornburg . It was odd to see a small city surrounded by a wall made for a much larger city. They received an advertisement for \"the largest inn in Thornburg \" called the Mighty Musk . They also heard a 'town crier' call out \"Hot, delicious meals at Tun Tavern .\" The party chose three rooms in the Mighty Musk . Elinor and Fuzula went for a well-earned bath while Hopeful meditated. That evening, Sigmund ( Gwyn ) did good works in the local community, learning that 7 influential families hold much of the power in Thornburg . They include the Furholm, Gladwell, and Volgo families. Gwyn also met a student injured at the Battle Mage Assembly. Gwyn noted that the term Battle Mage was the same one Averos found describing the Master of the Passion Place . Kereshi went looking for a place to learn more fighter profession skills.

They decided to leave the eerie area for the night by pushing forward instead of backtracking. Soon, they came upon a tower off the trail. Kereshi and Gwyn decided to investigate.

After about a mile from the tower, the notes of song birds once again serenaded the party. Along the way, the sharp eyes of Fuzula spied a couple hobgoblins walk past further down the path across a clearing. The third one spotted the party. Little was visible other than its head due to the foliage. As it took its bow off its back, Fuzula killed it. A 'large' deep voice said \"what was that.\" Another face appeared and Elinor 's readied Eldritch Blast killed it. A third appeared, but it decided to forego battle in order to run. Two distinct voices in the clearing argued a bit, one razzing the other about being scared of little humanoids. Kereshi snuck forward to get a look, then headed back by the party to hide. He saw a pair of 15' tall muscled creatures with clubs and sacks near a huge tree. They came to the head of the trail and said, \"Hey, what are you guys doing back there.\" Gwyn yelled that he was looking for his holy symbol he had lost. The rest of the party were in a position to suddenly attack the huge creatures if necessary. After a brief exchange following their question \"do you taste good,\" it was determined that they didn't want anything to do with the Necromancer ( Gwyn mentioned a juicy wizard), the trolls taste terrible, Gwyn 's god requires him to eat trolls, Gwyn probably tastes terrible too, and Gwyn thought the hobgoblins looked tasty. The giants went to see if they could find the hobgoblins. After another hour of travel, the group came to a rope bridge over a wide (30') not-too-deep but fast moving river. Kereshi worked her way down to the bank. After almost falling in the first few steps, she headed back up the bank. Using her Ring of Jumping, Kereshi jumped across the river, collected the end of the bridge, then jumped back across. Using the Mending gift from Hun Hoksa, Kereshi fixed the bridge on the cut ends. It was then good as new. Danger Inc. reached the location Caus said was the Passion Place . As the trail leads through the tall grass, it enters a wide woods. A few miles later, you reach the edge of the trees. Before you is a 60' high cliff. There is 200 feet of open space between you and a cave entrance. Some of the trees have been recently cut down and processed into firewood. At the entrance, you can see a nearly-square door a dozen feet wide. You can see the edge of a portcullis hanging down at the top. Two creatures lounge near the door. An ogre is sitting against the wall, tossing up a rock and catching it. Nearby, a giant animal basks in the sun; possibly a rat or a badger. In the distance, seven hobgoblins practice battle techniques as they perform tactical movements. Danger Inc. strolled in. Using the pass phrase, the ogre stood aside. He didn't follow them into the tunnel, although the party noted that he watched them from the other end. You pass under the portcullis dipping from the bright daylight into darkness. As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you're looking down a long hallway at least 50' long. There are four doors on each side. Along the hall in several places, there are blast marks that appear to have been caused by immense heat. They are sporadic along the hall with no clear source. As you move down the hallway you can see a large fire far ahead of you. There is a large shape in front of it, but it is well over 100' away and impossible to make out. Fuzula didn't find any traps or a source for the blast marks. They didn't seem to follow a pattern, so she suspected the blast marks were not part of a trap. A raised portcullis is at this end of the hallway as well. The hall it reveals is huge; almost 200' deep and probably 70' wide. Although cut from the rock, it is roughly a rectangle. As you enter the room, a strange corrupted smell hangs in the air. On both sides of the doorway, a badly burnt corpse stands unmoving. In the center of the room, a seat that would best be described as a rudimentary low-backed throne sits empty. Twenty feet behind it is a large fire in a pit. A 6' tall humanoid stands before the seat. His heavily muscled body is covered in skin the color of soot. His pants around his waist stop at the top of his calves and match the blackish blue color of his cloak. His bare chest shows the dark leather strap of his scabbard. His left hand rests on a large dog with jet black fur and glowing red eyes. The doorway you enter through allows 25' of floor before reaching a moat of viscous liquid. Three wooden bridges lie across its 5' span. A table set with bread and crackers sits against the wall far to your right. With the plates and bowls present, you imagine that fruits and meats may be added in time. Between the central chair and the entrance, there are four large squares painted on the floor; 10' by 20', 15' by 20', 20' by 20', and 30' by 30'. They look similar to fighting rings. The smallest of them has an unconscious dwarf sprawled face down. Three dummies and four targets are just to your left, allowing bow practice at distances from 30' to 200'. Hanging from the 30 foot ceiling are chains. Many of them at symmetrical intervals have metal containers with flames lipping up. These provide at least dim light throughout the entire room, augmented by the bon fire. Several chains instead hold up metal cages of a design that you would expect to hold a huge bird. The cages vary from 10 to 20 feet off the ground. All but one appear empty. In the back, a robed and hooded creature is slumped on the cage floor. At a distance of 150' from the door, you can make out no other details. Against the back wall, a green scaled dragon-like creature beats its wings while it's two legs grip a fence making up a large pen. A half-orc and two orcs watch laughing as a flustered human seems to be looking at the soot-colored humanoid in front of the throne, while gesturing at the beast. The beast must have growled or something else unheard at this distance, for the human quickly backed away from it with his hands up defensively. His three orcish companions broke out laughing hysterically. The back left corner is a 10' by 20' caged area with bars that look like a jail. However, the area appears to be for storage of stuff rather than prisoners. Against the left wall, a large table sits with a pair of elves, ebony in color, playing some form of cards; One male, one female. The firelight from the large fire flickers off their chain shirts. Another shirtless barrel-chested creature watches over them. His human torso and head are connected to the body of a lion. His chest was only covered by the strap of a quiver of arrows, that and the longbow. Turning facing you, the soot-colored man grabs a two-handed sword that was leaning against the back of the throne and slides it into his scabbard. Both the powerful soot-colored man and the human/lion [[chimera]] begin to move toward you. The man from the throne holds up a hand at the [[chimera]] and says, \"I've got the interlopers. You can stay with them.\" At that he strides across the room toward you. The [[chimera]] returns to the elves, but doesn't fully pull his attention away from you. As he gets closer, you can make out the piercing eyes with pupils the color of rubies. Caus whispers in an excited voice \"This is your chance. It's time to act.\" The characters were exchanging quick whispers as he approached. Even Kereshi considered this group a no win battle. Caus \"assured\" them that if they took down the Master, the other creatures wouldn't help him. She insists, 'they were only here out of fear.' Gwyn asked Caus where her brother was. She said a bit exasperated 'I don't know. I know he came here but I don't know what happened to him.' She again implored, \"We have to act now, we cannot hesitate.\" 'We can't give him time.' Gwyn stepped up to the microphone again. He parlayed, 'Who's butt do I have to kick to kneel with the Master.' The soot-colored man said, \"I guess that would be me.\" There was a brief exchange where the soot-colored man said, 'I am the Master.' Gwyn dug into the inconsistency he heard retorting, 'Now you say you're the Master. Earlier when I asked who I needed to beat to see the Master you said it was you. Well, which is it.\" At that point, the Master began to make an aggressive move that called for initiative.

A 'large' deep voice said \"what was that.\" Another face appeared and Elinor 's readied Eldritch Blast killed it. A third appeared, but it decided to forego battle in order to run. Two distinct voices in the clearing argued a bit, one razzing the other about being scared of little humanoids. Kereshi snuck forward to get a look, then headed back by the party to hide. He saw a pair of 15' tall muscled creatures with clubs and sacks near a huge tree. They came to the head of the trail and said, \"Hey, what are you guys doing back there.\" Gwyn yelled that he was looking for his holy symbol he had lost. The rest of the party were in a position to suddenly attack the huge creatures if necessary. After a brief exchange following their question \"do you taste good,\" it was determined that they didn't want anything to do with the Necromancer ( Gwyn mentioned a juicy wizard), the trolls taste terrible, Gwyn 's god requires him to eat trolls, Gwyn probably tastes terrible too, and Gwyn thought the hobgoblins looked tasty. The giants went to see if they could find the hobgoblins. After another hour of travel, the group came to a rope bridge over a wide (30') not-too-deep but fast moving river. Kereshi worked her way down to the bank. After almost falling in the first few steps, she headed back up the bank. Using her Ring of Jumping, Kereshi jumped across the river, collected the end of the bridge, then jumped back across. Using the Mending gift from Hun Hoksa, Kereshi fixed the bridge on the cut ends. It was then good as new. Danger Inc. reached the location Caus said was the Passion Place . As the trail leads through the tall grass, it enters a wide woods. A few miles later, you reach the edge of the trees. Before you is a 60' high cliff. There is 200 feet of open space between you and a cave entrance. Some of the trees have been recently cut down and processed into firewood. At the entrance, you can see a nearly-square door a dozen feet wide. You can see the edge of a portcullis hanging down at the top. Two creatures lounge near the door. An ogre is sitting against the wall, tossing up a rock and catching it. Nearby, a giant animal basks in the sun; possibly a rat or a badger. In the distance, seven hobgoblins practice battle techniques as they perform tactical movements. Danger Inc. strolled in. Using the pass phrase, the ogre stood aside. He didn't follow them into the tunnel, although the party noted that he watched them from the other end. You pass under the portcullis dipping from the bright daylight into darkness. As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you're looking down a long hallway at least 50' long. There are four doors on each side. Along the hall in several places, there are blast marks that appear to have been caused by immense heat. They are sporadic along the hall with no clear source. As you move down the hallway you can see a large fire far ahead of you. There is a large shape in front of it, but it is well over 100' away and impossible to make out. Fuzula didn't find any traps or a source for the blast marks. They didn't seem to follow a pattern, so she suspected the blast marks were not part of a trap. A raised portcullis is at this end of the hallway as well. The hall it reveals is huge; almost 200' deep and probably 70' wide. Although cut from the rock, it is roughly a rectangle. As you enter the room, a strange corrupted smell hangs in the air. On both sides of the doorway, a badly burnt corpse stands unmoving. In the center of the room, a seat that would best be described as a rudimentary low-backed throne sits empty. Twenty feet behind it is a large fire in a pit. A 6' tall humanoid stands before the seat. His heavily muscled body is covered in skin the color of soot. His pants around his waist stop at the top of his calves and match the blackish blue color of his cloak. His bare chest shows the dark leather strap of his scabbard. His left hand rests on a large dog with jet black fur and glowing red eyes. The doorway you enter through allows 25' of floor before reaching a moat of viscous liquid. Three wooden bridges lie across its 5' span. A table set with bread and crackers sits against the wall far to your right. With the plates and bowls present, you imagine that fruits and meats may be added in time. Between the central chair and the entrance, there are four large squares painted on the floor; 10' by 20', 15' by 20', 20' by 20', and 30' by 30'. They look similar to fighting rings. The smallest of them has an unconscious dwarf sprawled face down. Three dummies and four targets are just to your left, allowing bow practice at distances from 30' to 200'. Hanging from the 30 foot ceiling are chains. Many of them at symmetrical intervals have metal containers with flames lipping up. These provide at least dim light throughout the entire room, augmented by the bon fire. Several chains instead hold up metal cages of a design that you would expect to hold a huge bird. The cages vary from 10 to 20 feet off the ground. All but one appear empty. In the back, a robed and hooded creature is slumped on the cage floor. At a distance of 150' from the door, you can make out no other details. Against the back wall, a green scaled dragon-like creature beats its wings while it's two legs grip a fence making up a large pen. A half-orc and two orcs watch laughing as a flustered human seems to be looking at the soot-colored humanoid in front of the throne, while gesturing at the beast. The beast must have growled or something else unheard at this distance, for the human quickly backed away from it with his hands up defensively. His three orcish companions broke out laughing hysterically. The back left corner is a 10' by 20' caged area with bars that look like a jail. However, the area appears to be for storage of stuff rather than prisoners. Against the left wall, a large table sits with a pair of elves, ebony in color, playing some form of cards; One male, one female. The firelight from the large fire flickers off their chain shirts. Another shirtless barrel-chested creature watches over them. His human torso and head are connected to the body of a lion. His chest was only covered by the strap of a quiver of arrows, that and the longbow. Turning facing you, the soot-colored man grabs a two-handed sword that was leaning against the back of the throne and slides it into his scabbard. Both the powerful soot-colored man and the human/lion [[chimera]] begin to move toward you. The man from the throne holds up a hand at the [[chimera]] and says, \"I've got the interlopers. You can stay with them.\" At that he strides across the room toward you. The [[chimera]] returns to the elves, but doesn't fully pull his attention away from you. As he gets closer, you can make out the piercing eyes with pupils the color of rubies. Caus whispers in an excited voice \"This is your chance. It's time to act.\" The characters were exchanging quick whispers as he approached. Even Kereshi considered this group a no win battle. Caus \"assured\" them that if they took down the Master, the other creatures wouldn't help him. She insists, 'they were only here out of fear.' Gwyn asked Caus where her brother was. She said a bit exasperated 'I don't know. I know he came here but I don't know what happened to him.' She again implored, \"We have to act now, we cannot hesitate.\" 'We can't give him time.' Gwyn stepped up to the microphone again. He parlayed, 'Who's butt do I have to kick to kneel with the Master.' The soot-colored man said, \"I guess that would be me.\" There was a brief exchange where the soot-colored man said, 'I am the Master.' Gwyn dug into the inconsistency he heard retorting, 'Now you say you're the Master. Earlier when I asked who I needed to beat to see the Master you said it was you. Well, which is it.\" At that point, the Master began to make an aggressive move that called for initiative.

His spells ignore resistance to fire damage. Elinor issued retribution, first with Hellish Rebuke and then with her own fireball. The [[hell hound]] was unphased by the flames. Olgann was affected, at least partially. Each successive party member added their might to the attack; except Gwyn who focused on buffing the party. Olgann was later joined by the hell hound who wouldn't be held off any longer. Kereshi was fighting toe-to-toe with both Olgann and the hound. Olgann , after sustaining nearly 150 points of damage, lashed out with a chain lightning spell. Hopeful tried to counter it, but it was just out of her reach. It forked off of Gwyn to hit other party members. Gwyn , Fuzula , and Hopeful fell unconscious. Elinor stayed up thanks to the temporary health granted by Gwyn 's Twilight Sanctuary. Olgann let out a long whistle, then continued to do battle with the party. Elinor tried to reason with Olgann that they just \"got off on the wrong foot,\" we're really 'scholars,' and they had heard that a magic stone was here that they wanted to learn about. Olgann seemed unmoved. Elinor rushed to Gwyn 's aid and jolted him awake with a 3rd level Cure Wounds spell. Caus disappeared as the tides had turned against the party. Gwyn pleaded for the party members' lives. Olgann demanded he sheath his sword and Gwyn complied. Olgann put him to sleep. When the party awoke they were in cells. Olgann established the three rules. Then said he had to go deal with something and didn't have time to talk yet. Info One: You have all of your equipment. Don't make us regret it. I hate taking people's stuff and putting it in those foot lockers. Then you have to do something with the stuff that is too big. Next thing you know something is missing, and the orc gets blamed but the [[drow]] really took it. Morale suffers. It is just a mess. So I prefer to leave your stuff in your possession until I decide what I'm going to do with you. Two: Don't kill my people. I know you will be tempted to try to get some retribution since you have your weapons, but don't. It will irk me. Three: If you ignore that previous point, I will destroy you. You would not even be edible when I am done with you. Please trust me, I can do it. If you need a demonstration, volunteer for me to prove it. It may save your companions. Caus returned trying to make a deal with party members. She could secure party members freedom and help them sneak out in exchange for a condition (aka a deal). Examples of this were the recipient's first born, magic item compensation, or a promise to return at her bidding to try to kill The Master again. *None of the party members accepted, so she took back her 'circlet of protection' and disappeared. She and Danger Inc. had completed their tasks; namely her leading them to the Passion Place and their assistance in attempting to destroy The Master . Olgann returned for some conversation. Olgann noted that he realized Hopeful was \"one of Hun-Hoksa 's minions? How did I miss your garb? You guys can't be a murder squad.\" Olgann asked what they were called\u2026 Elinor said \" Danger Inc. .\" Olgann 's lair isn't normally referred to as the Passion Place , but it is an apt description. It is normally referred to as Tunnel Ecstasy . Note: Ecstasy defined as \"an overwhelming feeling of great happiness or joyful excitement.\" The feeling that one experiences when in success at pursuing their greatest passion. Olgann asked questions like\u2026 What is your passion? ( Elinor said \u2026) Olgann : What is your passion? - Gwyn said protect the weak Olgann : What is your drive? - Elinor said sense of family and safety Olgann : What do you pursue to be your legacy? - Kereshi said help save the world vs bringing an end to it; an ord that went down in history, not infamy Olgann : What do you desire to do or be known as? - Hopeful said be the best follower of Hun-Hoksa that I can (his is when Olgann opened her cell door). - Olgann asked questions about the cult, rituals, and locations. Elinor showed a card and he promised to return it. Olgann also shared\u2026. #ttrpg/loredump They are Power Stones . He would have called it a crimson Power Stone , not a Penetration Stone . He didn't know that name. There are different Power Stones . The ones mined from the lower [[planes]] were crimson and fused with necrotic/negative energy. Gwyn and Elinor noted he started to get cautious as they asked about his other Power Stones . When \"we got our stones\" Glorgona was trying to perform a ritual that would take one of the dwarven cities to Hell. She was assisted by a Knight of the Night tiefling named Majesty and a group of Deadstone Giants . Glorgona 's ritual required at least 4 stones, but she was working on getting a fifth when Jasper and crew stopped her. Olgan opened Hopeful , Elinor , and Gwyn 's cell gates by the end of the conversation. He would not give the party his penetration stone under any circumstances, as it is too dangerous for them to have two. When they offered to remove the 300 orcs campaigning on his doorstep, he would not give them his stone but did offer 2 magic items for the task. When Kereshi learned the orcs were from the Tear Bringers tribe, he wanted out of the cell to go take care of them himself. Olgann refused as Kereshi 's \"passion was too valuable to the world to let him get killed like that.\" Although you were clearly expected to stay in the room despite some of your cells being open, Olgann said he would be back in an hour to further the discussion. Gwyn , or maybe just John Bruckler, thought it was odd that Olgann was fighting with them and now suddenly seems willing to \"help\" them.

To trust or not to trust; it always seems to come back to that. Olgann returned and cast a spell to appear as a human with his proportions, but a face that looks strikingly like Elinor (as if her brother) Olgann tells them they don't look much worse for the wear \"despite a ferocious quarrel.\" He states his compatriot Simmer contacted Claude ( Hun-Hoksa 's Physic Negotiator) who vouched for them. He said Hun-Hoksa asked for him to help them if he would. He said he would provide information that helps them pursue the crimson Power Stones on three conditions\u2026 They never possess more than 2 at a time They turn one of the recovered stones over to him for safe keeping The party gives him 14 gp and 7 sp for each stone he tells them about. When Fuzula asked how she can be sure she can trust him, he said 'how can we ever be sure of that. Maybe you can contact one of Hun-Hoksa 's minions who have met me; Claude , Leoris , Freddie .' He gives them another half an hour to think about it. During that time, Gwyn used Sending spell to contact Freddie . Freddie quickly responded ' Olgann is shady. Not sure I would \"trust\" him, but he can be trusted with the stones.' Olgann tells them about Jasper 's Stone of Power guarded by Olgann . He tells the story how Glorgona , Majesty , and the Deadstone Giants tried to send the dwarven city of Keg Torum into Hell. Eventually, they attracted the attention of a heroic Drow and a pair of competing Heros, namely Augustus Volgo and Jasper Martin. Olgann tells them about the dwarves Stone of Power probably still in the vaults of Strolbreln Tower . The Strolbreln Tower was built by the dwarven artisan Ragbek Roughbeard over a century ago as a forward watch tower for Keg Torum , the southern city and stronghold of the dwarves. During the Northern Invasion , the dwarves abandoned the tower and withdrew their forces to the city's defenses. While war raged, a human lord from what is now the [[Conquered Lands]], mustered people to quickly build a fort on a high hill overlooked by the tower. Within a year of its completion, the fort and tower fell. These days, the fort is a central feature of the hobgoblin city of Kondraroc . Hobgoblins maintain the tower to watch for invading armies and massive monsters. But Olgann suspects neither the human lord nor the hobgoblin sentry were able to get into the vault. Olgann told the party the Demon's Door is up the trail from Strolbreln Tower . It will be quite a trek through the Ravaged Lands to get to them. Olgann tells them about Grinvah Dreedasesh 's Stone of Power probably still in the Underdark . It is believed that he took it to his home estate. Despite being over 50 years ago, Olgann thinks it is likely to still be within the Dreedasesh estate . He also mentioned a spy he knew ([[Aleashia]] - she has some magical device to infiltrate the drow) was captured north of the tower by hill giants. It was a few months ago, so he doesn't know their current state. Olgann 's intense praise of Jasper has some in the party believing he is actually Jasper . Kereshi handed over the party's Penetration Stone , so they can collect more than 1 Stone while on the road (they agreed to limit their possession to 2 at a time). Kereshi , Elinor , and Fuzula were allowed to follow him to where he stored his treasures in the back of the main room. While he crossed over the blue line to enter it, his spell dropped and he no longer looked like Elinor . His \"sister\" Elinor feigned being taken aback when she wasn't invited to the party. Olgann ended up inviting her. While most of Danger Inc. was at the party, Gwyn used the Sending spell from the cells to send Averos a message. Gwyn said 'You're betrayal failed. We are still alive.' Averos responded, \"I have no idea what you are talking about.\" An orc from the Skull Crusher clan thought he caught Elinor cheating at dice. There were four Skull Crushers at the party. A [[hobgoblin warlord]] was present named Grudanol who is a mean brute. He backhanded and bloodied an orc that was helping with the guests. Olgann came off his chair up to the warlord. Both Grudanol 's elite captains pulled their weapons but hesitated to attack; one just looked nervous while the other looked to Grudanol for orders. Olgann ignores them, walking within striking distance with his attention on Grudanol . \"The help\" is under his protection during this event. Olgann forbade Grudanol from using the ecstasy cage. Grudanol decided he didn't want to use it anyway. Once resolved, Olgann became friendly again. Kereshi , taking offense at the orc's treatment, approached to help the hurting orc at the end of the episode. The embarrassed orc, who goes by the nickname Skull Defacer , was a bit short with Kereshi and didn't want any help. Kereshi went to talk at the hobgoblin trio who had migrated to the food table. Recognizing some risk, Kereshi started provoking one of the hobgoblin elite captains. The hobgoblin was dismissive saying they couldn't kill in here, he kills not hurts enemies, he won't disregard his duties for no reason, and Kereshi lacked discipline. Kereshi said he would be happy to meet them outside. The hobgoblin trio heads for the door. After waiting a minute, Kereshi follows. Fuzula pleads with Olgann to intervene. Although hesitant since it is Kereshi 's choice, her persistence prods him. Since he told Hun-Hoksa he would help (with information), he got off his chair. Olgann follows Kereshi down the hall and convinces her to stand down. If he does, they can figure out one other thing the party can do in return and Olgann can teleport the group to the Demons Door . With Kereshi concerned the hobgoblins would goad her and she couldn't ignore that, Olgann said he would tell the [[hobgoblin warlord]] that he required her to stand down. As Olgann returns to the main room, the [[drow elite warrior]]'s guards were positioning themselves to surround Asuilo ; the female drow playing cards when the party first arrived. Olgann wants to know if the drow leader's appearance is a betrayal and makes it clear that Asuilo is under his protection within the Ecstasy Tunnels . The drow leader apologizes for any misunderstanding that may have happened. While Asuilo is a marked woman, he would not think of carry out her arrest in Olgann 's lair. \"No offense to the master of this house was intended.\" His deference to Olgann is palpable, although Olgann returns a respectful nod. Fuzula noticed a human leaning against the wall paying particular attention to her and Kereshi . Neither of them recognized him, but he seemed to recognize them. He had a snake head tattoo on the back of his left hand.

Averos responded, \"I have no idea what you are talking about.\" An orc from the Skull Crusher clan thought he caught Elinor cheating at dice. There were four Skull Crushers at the party. A [[hobgoblin warlord]] was present named Grudanol who is a mean brute. He backhanded and bloodied an orc that was helping with the guests. Olgann came off his chair up to the warlord. Both Grudanol 's elite captains pulled their weapons but hesitated to attack; one just looked nervous while the other looked to Grudanol for orders. Olgann ignores them, walking within striking distance with his attention on Grudanol . \"The help\" is under his protection during this event. Olgann forbade Grudanol from using the ecstasy cage. Grudanol decided he didn't want to use it anyway. Once resolved, Olgann became friendly again. Kereshi , taking offense at the orc's treatment, approached to help the hurting orc at the end of the episode. The embarrassed orc, who goes by the nickname Skull Defacer , was a bit short with Kereshi and didn't want any help. Kereshi went to talk at the hobgoblin trio who had migrated to the food table. Recognizing some risk, Kereshi started provoking one of the hobgoblin elite captains. The hobgoblin was dismissive saying they couldn't kill in here, he kills not hurts enemies, he won't disregard his duties for no reason, and Kereshi lacked discipline. Kereshi said he would be happy to meet them outside. The hobgoblin trio heads for the door. After waiting a minute, Kereshi follows. Fuzula pleads with Olgann to intervene. Although hesitant since it is Kereshi 's choice, her persistence prods him. Since he told Hun-Hoksa he would help (with information), he got off his chair. Olgann follows Kereshi down the hall and convinces her to stand down. If he does, they can figure out one other thing the party can do in return and Olgann can teleport the group to the Demons Door . With Kereshi concerned the hobgoblins would goad her and she couldn't ignore that, Olgann said he would tell the [[hobgoblin warlord]] that he required her to stand down. As Olgann returns to the main room, the [[drow elite warrior]]'s guards were positioning themselves to surround Asuilo ; the female drow playing cards when the party first arrived. Olgann wants to know if the drow leader's appearance is a betrayal and makes it clear that Asuilo is under his protection within the Ecstasy Tunnels . The drow leader apologizes for any misunderstanding that may have happened. While Asuilo is a marked woman, he would not think of carry out her arrest in Olgann 's lair. \"No offense to the master of this house was intended.\" His deference to Olgann is palpable, although Olgann returns a respectful nod. Fuzula noticed a human leaning against the wall paying particular attention to her and Kereshi . Neither of them recognized him, but he seemed to recognize them. He had a snake head tattoo on the back of his left hand.

It approached. The orc asked Kereshi about her tribe markings and if it meant the revival of the Skorch Skull clan. Kereshi said she was the only member of the revival thus far, and wears it as a symbol of resistance to the Tear Bringers tribe. Three [[magic items]] were available for trade; four counting Hopeful 's Amulet of Kwallip . Elinor asked about the dagger (Dagger +1) and the orc said he would sell it for 1,300 if she didn't have an item to trade. He wouldn't accept services as part of the payment because he didn't know her well enough. None of the traders were interested in the Amulet of Kwallip , but Olgann was. He traded Hopeful a magic dagger (Dagger +2) and a casting of Legend Lore for the amulet. The party spent the night in the cells, while Olgann took Kipp the hell hound \"for a walk.\" In the morning while some filled their pockets with cheese, Olgann cast the Legend Lore spell on Soul Striker . Soul Striker was created by Hiisi for the Eternal One . Soul Striker was entrusted to Tloques-Popolocas , an ancient warrior of renown. The grave robbers who stole it from his tomb can be found by Agents of Tloques for 1 year. It joins three items created by the Eternal One to be the 4 items considered the Eternal Artifacts . Any of the Eternal Artifacts can be used as an arcane focus and as a component of rituals to create powerful undead abominations. Olgann said the agents of Tloques-Popolocas cannot find the possessor of Soul Striker when it is in the Bag of Holding. Olgann teleported the party to the trail that leads from the Strolbreln Tower to what is left of the dwarven stronghold of Keg Torum . He also told them where to turn off the trail to get to the Demon's Door and where the abandoned tower was that would indicate to leave the mountain base to head for the hill giant longhouse. Before teleporting away, Olgann polymorphed Elinor into an owl. She got a good look at the tower. As you stand on the rocky bluff, the smell of pine assaults your senses. The wind from the mountains above you bring cold air rushing past you. It cautions you not to get too close to the edge or you may endure a 50 foot drop that ends with a sudden stop. The mountain continues down from there in a rugged land at a steep angle. The hills are several hundred feet below. About a half mile away, you can see a squat tower sitting on a similar sharp drop. It commands a clear view of the landscape. Its parapet roof is about even with you, allowing you to barely see three humanoids walking along the roof. A large gong sits near the roof's center. Built on an outcropping that keeps it from being too close to the mountainside, the tower is a formidable defensive position. The several places where water expels from the mountainside suggests that the tower has fresh water within its belly. In the hillside below, a large city with wooden walls rests. From this distance you can't make out any obvious details, but the smoke and frequent nondescript movement make it obvious it is a vibrant home to many. Near its center, it appears to have fortress with rough walls and crude angles sitting atop a hill. Approaching the tower is not too difficult for a small group, although only so close. About 40 feet from the tower, you can get a fairly clear look at it. It appears to be ancient, with long-weathered stone making up its external walls. A path leads up the face of the mountain to a front door exposed to the air more than the mountain, although standing rock would protect someone from below if walking around the tower. At 45' high, the parapets provide excellent protection for anyone standing watch on the roof. The trail leads to a 1' high platform about 10' deep and 15' wide. A small ridge runs around the platform with a few holes to let out rain. Directly above the platform, a protrusion of stone with a foot diameter hole suggests any manner of liquid or material that could be dropped on the platform on anyone who tried to force their way through the stone door. Several feet above the door is a stone plaque that reads something in dwarven in shallow, worn letters.

With Steps of Night, Gwyn carried Fuzula to the top of the tower. In an 'invisible train,' between Elinor 's spell and Kereshi 's potion, Elinor , Hopeful , and Kereshi headed toward the front door. As he became visible over the edge of the tower, Gwyn cast Sleep and put the three rooftop guards to sleep. Gwyn and Fuzula secured them tightly. Down below, Elinor knocked on the door but no one came out. Instead someone inside headed toward the top of the tower. With a mix of 'don't want to hurt any of you' and 'will kill you and not care,' Gwyn scared the captured hobgoblin into silence, other than mentioning how to get the guards below to unlock the trap door for entry. Gwyn put 2 more hobgoblin guards to sleep. With unusual grace and finesse, except maybe the landing, Gwyn glided through the trap door to land on a hobgoblin runner. The runner, true to his role, was able to get away and head down stairs. With great athleticism (and a little help from her ring), Kereshi jumped from window to window until he found an unprotected one she could break in. She found herself in the same room as Fuzula . After regrouping briefly, the three headed down in close pursuit of the hobgoblin runner. Meanwhile, Elinor finally got the front door unbarred to gain access for her and Hopeful . Elinor and Hopeful defeated the two hobgoblins on the ground floor. They joined the progression headed down the stairs. The first one at the bottom, Kereshi set off a trap alerting nearby hobgoblins of the party's presence. Encountering more resistance in the basement, the party fought the captain of the post, his remaining sergeant, and several hobgoblin soldiers.

He found some papers including a roster written in goblin. Elinor , with the aid of a Comprehend Language spell, found that there were 15 hobgoblins assigned to the captain/commander of the tower. Danger Inc. began to move toward two of the three doors on the right side of the hall. Elinor waited to make sure that Kereshi didn't need help. Kereshi found a well hidden, wire-thin trap on the door. With great skill she was able to disable the trap so it couldn't hurt anyone. While Kereshi appreciated Elinor 's mentoring, it was clear to her that the student had become the master. Kereshi walked into the kitchen. Inside were two goblins cooking and a hobgoblin in studded leather eating. The hobgoblin jailor was not even slightly intimidated by Kereshi 's best efforts. This infuriated her and she devastated the hobgoblin with a frenzied attack and a forced zap of Soul Striker . Gwyn acquired the party's first retainers for the Chillin Tower ; namely the goblin cooks. If they are still there when the party returns this way, they are hired. If reinforcements arrive at Strolbreln Tower first, they \"never saw us.\" At 3 sp a week, they were excited by the job opportunity. So much so that one offered to carry Gwyn 's sword. For that wage, they would even touch fresh food; the sacrifices people will make for a coin. The goblins made Gwyn a sandwich. They didn't know of a dwarven vault or safe, so they assume it is behind the \"evil door.\" While the party explores, they are making sandwiches for everyone. But if reinforcements show up from the city, they will be giving the sandwiches to the hobgoblins. Elinor found food stuff in the other room. They were not fresh, but were edible. Hopeful snuck up on a human locked in the jail, then backed away. Elinor and Gwyn went to parley with the prisoner. His name is Argon and his party \"didn't make it\" when he was captured. The hobgoblins took his spellbook to the hobgoblin city, probably along with the rest of his equipment. Argon said in the CIC ( Confederation of Independent City-States , or just Confederation ), a group of cultists had been causing trouble including arson and other harassment. Argon 's group was hired to investigate rumors the Cult of Indimordor originated from this area. The cult is dedicated to Indimordor , a powerful demon. Argon cast Misty Step to get out of the cell. He started getting heavy armor (Chain Mail), shield, and long sword off of the fallen hobgoblins. Elinor used the key from the jailor's radiated body to unlock his irons. Later, the DM cheated and let him cast Bless on the party\u2026he didn't have the material components needed for that spell. He implied (or maybe stated) that he didn't leave earlier because without his spellbook or night watch he didn't know how he could make the trek back to civilization. There isn't really any trust between the party and Argon yet, so the party is keeping him close. He is willing to go further into the tower for his share of the treasure recovered. Gwyn said he would get \"a share\" of the treasure, in keeping with his ability to contribute. Elinor said that he better not betray the party or he will get nothing. Argon said the party better not betray him or they'll get something. None of the maneuvering seemed overly aggressive or incite-ful. The \"evil door\" was next. Before you stand a set of double doors. A chain with a padlock passes through the handles preventing further advance. These long standing doors have words in common written on them in aged and peeling paint. The words include \"Stay Out\" and \"Keep Locked\". Additionally, a sign with neatly stenciled words in goblin says \"By the word of the Tower Commander, do not unlock or open this door. Death awaits beyond.\" In addition to the padlock, the doors are boarded. It appears that there was once a board roughly tacked between the doors. Based on the age of the nail holes, it was removed long ago. But in its place is a board attached to the top of the doors and the wall above the doorway. Similarly a board is spiked to the floor that would also inhibit the doors from swinging open. Elinor picked the lock. While the boards were pried out, Fuzula rushed to check out the last unexplored hall on this side of the 'evil door.' It was an armory where she refilled her quiver and brought Gwyn a mace named Firefly . She also found 100 gp, 150 sp, and 100 cp that she put in her pockets with her other valuables\u2026namely her pancakes and syrup she is saving for later. Bringing it back to the party, Kereshi directed her toward Elinor . With the bearing of an expert deceiver, Elinor took the coins showing nothing but gratitude\u2026that is she took them AFTER she cast Prestidigitation to clean them. Seeing the hall behind the double doors, Fuzula 's arrows bit into the zombies found there. Gwyn 's Destroy Undead power made quick work of most of them. Kereshi rushed down a side hall toward a commotion with caution to the wind. She found herself surrounded by a strange undead that has been seen in and around penetration stone [[Binding Site|Binding Sites]].

They included official correspondence and a young would-be sage's notes. She shared her findings with the rest of the party. One letter written in a scribbled hand, directs the Keg Torum warden to put an artifact in the inner vault of the safe for security reasons. It describes the artifact as dangerous and shouldn't be handled more than necessary, but safeguarding it is necessary for the protection of Keg Torum . Another letter (see below) describes the undead produced by the Penetration Stone (aka Crimson Power Stones ). After showing the letters to the party, Kereshi realized there was scraping on the other side of the wall. Gwyn went to a nearby unopened door off the main hall. Listening, he heard some movement in the room. Hopeful 's spider peered under the door with Hopeful sharing its senses. They saw four of the undead who move like chimpanzees with a humanoid like undead standing erect.

Realizing the two rooms probably hold danger but the party is using its resources, they begun down the hallway leaving the rooms for later. Gwyn and Kereshi , followed by Elinor , headed down the hall. They reached another door, one of hardwood but reinforced with an unusual number of metal bands; 4 instead of 2. Gwyn called to the creatures down the hall but they didn't come out. Kereshi decided to test the door and found that it opened. Several zombies and 3 wights attacked the party from the hall. Their ruse to get the party to rush into harm's way failed, but they attacked with gusto (and hatred). One of the wights attacked with the zombies while the other two rushed in and out of the hallway taking shots at folks. Before the battle was over, Kereshi was down to single digit hit points. In the ensuing battle, Kereshi , Elinor , and later Hopeful ended up at the vault doors. Gwyn and Argon ended up in the dwarven armory. In the dwarven armory, Argon had found a ring among the papers, wood, cloth, and metal on the floor. Hopeful found a room with blue, green, black, and yellow walls. The wall colors didn't seem to have any purpose any longer. The party decided they were running low on resources and brainstormed ways to take a much needed rest. They settled on Fuzula using carpenter tools to drill a hole in the door with the common and goblin warnings, Elinor cast the Fly spell on Fuzula , Fuzula put the door blocks back, then Fuzula casts Misty Step to pass through the door (using the drill hole). It seemed to work well. DM THINKS THE GOBLINS WERE LEFT OUTSIDE WHEN DONE. Elinor ritual cast Detect Magic. The vault doors are magical, but the padlock isn't. She also found or verified the studded leather armor on the wight that looked like it had fine clothing on was magical. She also could tell there was magic behind the door off the big hall and three magic spots behind the scratched and gouged mural. While low on resources but not depleted, the party decided to clear the room off the main hall. They prepared themselves for Kereshi to open the door. Elinor would cast fireball (or Enemies Abound) into the room. The rest of the party was fanned out as well. Kereshi pulled the piton and went to pull open the door. However, it was locked. So she decided to kick it in. Roll initiative! Info To myself: It is another day gone by. After tolling at my boring duties, I have spent another night deep in my readings. I have found some interesting information as I watch the sun rise. My father says I am a fool to spend so much of my share on my research. But these inquiries is all that keeps me sane at this post. Ever since that red power stone arrived 18 months ago, I have been intrigued by it (father would say obsessed). I once dreamed of writing papers and books for scholars, but I\u2019m relegated to writing notes to myself. It is surprising to learn that these power stones can produce different kinds of undeath. I\u2019ve tried to tell father they are even more dangerous than he thinks, but he still thinks of my research as the machinations of a fable-intoxicated youth. He does still believe the rumors that the stones can raise the dead as skeletons like a common necromancy spell. He simply doesn\u2019t believe that rituals can make them produce ghouls worthy of [[Orcus]]\u2019s pride. But it is right there in ink and parchment. But these new revelations are amazing\u2026and horrifying. Piecing together the texts and Trasman\u2019s discoveries, they can also produce undead called Eternal Agents by some. They develop as 3 distinct products, very different from each other. All of them resist regular weapons, among other destructive forces, but are bothered by silvered blades. The lesser incarnation is a bestial creature, fast and blood-thirsty. They run on all fours and can climb sheer surfaces faster than a gnome can run across an open field. Crimson skin and dark black hair adds to the evilness of their look. It is haunting. And they hunt in packs, like wolves. Dying to one of these monsters, you could lose your own soul. For there is some reference to the unfortunate soul raised as a mere shadow. The standard version looks a lot more like a human from the wild lands. It uses swords and sorcery rather than claws and bite. They are more cunning than the lesser version, but still simple. And they aren\u2019t vulnerable to heavenly spells as the lesser version. The greater version is still a bit of a mystery. They are at least 3 dwarves in height and not very inventive. But also unflappable in their patience and pursuits, unusual for undead. But they can destroy life in a wink. Some find their abjuration spells difficult to overcome. Well, wish me luck. After being up all night, it will be hard to not be distracted while pretending to be a junior accountant; especially with such an amazing discovery. ^9465c3","title":"054-20210928"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/054-20210928/#054-20210928","text":"Info campaign:: SumonHo date:: 2021-09-28 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: Don Warnecke Last Session: 053-20210921 Info ^summary","title":"054-20210928"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/054-20210928/#session-log","text":"Kereshi , alone again, found papers strewn around the room.

Hopeful dispelled the magic on the doors. Elinor took her sweet time picking the lock. The difficulty of the effective padlock took over 3 minutes to finally pick. Fuzula , after the frustration of waiting for the padlock to open, scouted stealthfully ahead. While she kept an eye out for creature threats, she set off a poisonous gas trap in the floor. Luckily, despite a particularly potent gas (8,8,8,7,4 on 5d8), Fuzula 's natural resistance to poison allowed her to keep going. Finding the outer vault, Fuzula directed the rest of the party over the trap trigger. They spent some time going over the items in the room.

Much is decaying, but much has also survived its time in this musty place. Fuzula found a book written in dwarven ( The Diary of a Hermit King : This is a book written by a dwarven hermit named Horkdram . Through a series of ill-fated close calls and daring feats, he saves the dwarven people. After political intrigue causes much strife in the leadership, Horkdram steps forward and is crowned king. It is a story of hope and persistence. It is unclear whether the story is fictitious or describes a far-off land.) Hopeful found three books she thought would be useful. A book written in undercommon that went into the possession of Gwyn . ( Undermist Travel : This is a thin book with a leather binding with some chapters written in Undercommon. The Undermist is a subterranean level found between the Underdark and the Underground (below ground, under the Surface). It is a frightful place of porous rock and an unnatural smoke-filled atmosphere. Visibility is limited even with dwarven darkvision, with some spots restricting visibility to inches. This guide describes travel through the Undermist . It describes difficulty seeing, the native mist (more like smoke than mist), the futility of trying to expel the mist, and the denizens of the level. These denizens include will-o-wisps and \"ash whispers;\" and little else. Ash whisperers are creatures that appear as a plume of ash. The take and dish out little physical damage but can cause incredible mental anguish. The Undermist is sometimes referred to as the Netherground .) A book written in dwarven. Kereshi can generally read it, but she struggles with some of the words and many of the concepts. Hopeful is at least a little disappointed to realize with the talk of demons, the book probably doesn't actually describe a part of the Nine Hells. ( The Jungle Hell : This book is written in dwarven. It describes an other-planar land of thick jungles with oppressive humidity. Most of the vegetation is blood-red surrounded by craggy mountains. The cloudless crimson sky has a multitude of portals opening to other realms. It describes elephants, giant centipedes, spiders, will-o-wisps, and demons (especially an aggressive, soul eating fiend known as a nabassus).) A book that is as much a collection of papers as it is a book. Hopeful plans to read this book written in common. (The Perilous Realms \u2013 An elven traveler named Llastoray wrote this book describing several realms that he considers inhospitable. They include a mountainous region in the western Barrier Mountains that is home to Argorgantis the Devourer (elder white dragon), a desolate place deep in the swamps to the west that is home to Yither the Eternal (elder black dragon), a razed land called Nowhere which contains the remains of the Eternal One , a diverse subterranean city called Drinverth ruled by a druegar king, and a portal that leads to a long forgotten region similar to this land with a large corrupted port city called Waterdeep .) Danger Inc. 's path was blocked by a portcullis. In the next room was a lever. Hopeful utilized Larry the Rope of Entanglement to lift the lever. The portcullis zipped up, but a flexible Larry was undamaged. In the decaying food storage room, the only surviving nutrition was a Backpack of Edibles . Inside are containers of water, a little ale, fruits, jerky, cornbread, and other nutritious food. While enough to sustain 8 people, it is not delectable. For example, the apples are a little tart, the pancakes are somewhat gummy, and the syrup is bittersweet. The Backpack of Edibles was placed in Kereshi 's bag of holding. Behind a beautifully crafted door was a finely adorned hall\u2026filled with grotesque dwarven zombies. An ornate stone and wood bridge rises over a 5' wide river that runs diagonally across the room with the flowing water collecting in a 10' by 15' pool. The ceiling of this cavernous room is over 20' high. As the party destroyed the last of the zombies, waves washed over the bridge. A 12' tall, muscular male stands on the bridge after most of the water washes away. He is Nabrim the Terrific, consort to the most honorable and wise Mufti Bitrabi , arbitrator of the Sixth League of Ramor-standis . He demands to know why the \"motley crew\" is in his abode. Elinor honestly states they are looking for a magical stone that is in this vault. Nabrim points out that it is in \"my vault,\" since he has moved into this complex. He seemed to respond well to compliments. After a brief dialog, Nabrim says that if they clear out the vault, he will let the group take 3 items, \"amongst them.\" They agreed. He seemed to respond well to compliments. Nabrim was willing to make such a deal so he doesn't have to bother doing it himself while on vacation. It takes a puny creature to comfortably travel through the hallways, unless in gaseous form. While the party prepared to go to the inner vault, Nabrim laid on top of the water to relax. Within the first room off of the splendid hall, a former barracks or dormitory housed an Eternal Agent , 3 archer skeletons, and 3 wild warriors glare at you as their long swords.","title":"056-20220315"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/056-20220315/#056-20220315","text":"Info campaign:: SumonHo date:: 2022-03-15 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: Don Warnecke Last Session: 055-20220215 Info ^summary","title":"056-20220315"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/056-20220315/#session-log","text":"After a decent slumber in a tight space, the party exited the armory to head for the vault doors.

Using his faith to channel the power of his deity, Gwyn immediately destroyed all three skeletons and drove fear into the Eternal Agent . Soon afterward all the undead were lifeless. While passing into the vault challenge room, Argon picked up a magic battle ax off the Eternal Agent and Elinor picked up a Necklace of Prayer Beads From Strolbreln Tower off a skeleton. Fuzula led them past the bars that separated the room and had just enough skill to pick the lock on the inner vault door. The vault had marvelous wealth within. Chests and sacks of gold sat on the ground and tables. Sticking out of the coins were various items; rods, boots, bracers, and arrows. A beautiful set of splint armor sat a few feet from a gleaming breastplate. On the large table beside a chest and a sack, a brazier full of gems glisten in any light near them. As the party tried to make the tough decision of which 3 magic items to take, Fuzula clarified with Nabrim the Terrific that the party could take a total of 3 items, not 3 each. These three items were in addition to the maroon Stone of Power . After much deliberation and moving the wealth from the inner vault to the bathing room, they left with the Scepter of Eternal Winter, Bracers of Shadow Boxing, and Gauntlets of Ogre Power. With the Penetration Stone tucked snuggly in Kereshi 's bag of holding, the party left behind the immovable rod and other precious items. As the party reached the bridge to leave, Nabrim the Terrific asked them how many items they had taken from the vault. He watched each of them intently as they stated they only had the offered three items. Satisfied, the party left unmolested. Gwyn tried to persuade the being that the Unmovable Rod was ugly and may be unwanted by Nabrim . *When Nabrim the Terrific said he may be willing to trade the rod, he declined the offered Auntie Summoning Solution. However, he did trade another random potion for it. The potion turned out to be a potion of acid resistance. Nabrim the Terrific didn't have an idea for them to escape the basement without going through the above ground portion of the watch tower. The river through the Reserve Hall had a barrier farther down so that way would not work. As the party worked their way back through the safe/vault and the other sealed rooms, they remembered an unexplored area hidden behind a wall. Danger Inc. found an escape tunnel that led 2 miles away from the Strolbreln Tower ; raising elevation but with many rises and dips. Danger Inc. exited the escape tunnel\u2026the SECRET TUNNEL\u2026 on a steep slope among numerous scrubby bushes. Working their way down goat paths and dried up watersheds, they worked their way down the trail. The brush was often sparse but also thick at times. After 45 minutes of hard work and sometimes treacherous footing, the group found a level place with sufficient cover to hide them but enough room to be comfortable. There, they began their rest until morning. The party members achieved 7th Level.

As the party tried to make the tough decision of which 3 magic items to take, Fuzula clarified with Nabrim the Terrific that the party could take a total of 3 items, not 3 each. These three items were in addition to the maroon Stone of Power . After much deliberation and moving the wealth from the inner vault to the bathing room, they left with the Scepter of Eternal Winter, Bracers of Shadow Boxing, and Gauntlets of Ogre Power. With the Penetration Stone tucked snuggly in Kereshi 's bag of holding, the party left behind the immovable rod and other precious items. As the party reached the bridge to leave, Nabrim the Terrific asked them how many items they had taken from the vault. He watched each of them intently as they stated they only had the offered three items. Satisfied, the party left unmolested. Gwyn tried to persuade the being that the Unmovable Rod was ugly and may be unwanted by Nabrim . *When Nabrim the Terrific said he may be willing to trade the rod, he declined the offered Auntie Summoning Solution. However, he did trade another random potion for it. The potion turned out to be a potion of acid resistance. Nabrim the Terrific didn't have an idea for them to escape the basement without going through the above ground portion of the watch tower. The river through the Reserve Hall had a barrier farther down so that way would not work. As the party worked their way back through the safe/vault and the other sealed rooms, they remembered an unexplored area hidden behind a wall. Danger Inc. found an escape tunnel that led 2 miles away from the Strolbreln Tower ; raising elevation but with many rises and dips. Danger Inc. exited the escape tunnel\u2026the SECRET TUNNEL\u2026 on a steep slope among numerous scrubby bushes. Working their way down goat paths and dried up watersheds, they worked their way down the trail. The brush was often sparse but also thick at times. After 45 minutes of hard work and sometimes treacherous footing, the group found a level place with sufficient cover to hide them but enough room to be comfortable. There, they began their rest until morning. The party members achieved 7th Level.

Before long, Danger Inc. came to a dilapidated tower that once served as advance notice and defense for the dwarven city. Rendered invisible by Elinor , Fuzula went forward to investigate. She found a hill giant singing a mournful [and loud and sickly] tune of sorrow. Pretending to be a talking bird, Fuzula learned that the hill giant 's husband [[Hruk]] was taken by [[Chief Olgabrawn]]. She took all the husbands and ran off their spouses. The Chief took them to boss them around and make them bring her food. Fuzula said, \"Isn't that your job?\" The hill giant said, 'Yes, that is why it is so terrible.' She began balling again. The hill giant pointed out where the hill giant home is, roughly 90 minutes away. While traveling to their destination, the thick brush gave way to a group of gnolls and a chained troll.

We decide to talk to Elinor to see if she can get a copy of the riddle, since she is a bard and has an interest in retrieving legends and such. The riddle: Info Search ye far or search ye near You\u2019ll find no trace of the three Unless you follow instructions clear For they abide with me. North past forest, farm and furrow You must go to the feathered mound Then down away from the sun you\u2019ll burrow Forget life, forget light, forget sound. To rescue Wave, you must do battle With the Beast in the Boiling Bubble Crost cavern vast, where chain-links rattle Lies Flelm, past water-spouts double. Blast-favor yet remains to be won Underneath inverted ziggurat. That garnered, think not that you\u2019re done For now you\u2019ll find you are caught I care not, former owners brave What heroes you seek to hire. Though mighty, I\u2019ll make each one my slave Or send him to the fire. We decided to head to the Dreedasesh estate , in the Underdark . Travel 1/2way to tower in mist (wind walker). Ritual cast Leomund's Tiny Hut. We long rest, then use the prayer bead to windwalk again, getting about 100 yards past the tower. Roughly 3pm Prayer bead @17:00 -- 8 hours --> stop at 03:00 and rest until 07:00 (dawn), then Prayer Bead --> 15:00 Don's Notes: Danger Incorporated entered the Chillin\u2019 Tower to spend the night. Raiding the kitchen, there was little food to make a meal with although many snacks were present (even if a bit stale). In a bout of luck, the party found pancake mix. Fuzula hooked them up with lots of pancakes. After a dry, warm night\u2019s sleep in the only bedroom in the tower, the party headed back to Olgann \u2019s home. The uneventful trip brought them to the tunnel guarded by the same ogre as before and a very dim-witted and unrefined orc. Still, the passcode gained them entry. The orc complained about Jasper being a \u2018do-gooder\u2019 and \u2018very human.\u2019 He said Jasper doesn\u2019t come around here but that he lived close by though. Gwyn later claimed to Olgann that the \u2018orc at the door\u2019 was \u2018praising Jasper to high heaven\u2019 [or something similar]. In Olgann \u2019s hall, Elinor went to talk to Dranaste and joined the card game with Dronaste, Misty, and Aleashia. Fuzula went to look at the 4 new statues ( Olgann later said they were automations). Gwyn went to pay respect to Olgann . Olgann was talking to \u201cCap,\u201d the human/lion chimera, about a deal they were trying to marshal. Before Gwyn left, Olgann stated that he could use their assistance. He was making a deal with a business partner for an exchange of services. The partner had a riddle that talked of three items. In exchange for a magical service for an important person to Olgann , Olgann would see to it that the remaining items were retrieved for the partner. [Note: Olgann mentioned the riddle talks of three items. However, the business partner believes one item has been recovered by another party due to historical references to it. So Danger Incorporated is only expected to find 2 items when they get there. That detail should come out when the party returns for the riddle and the location of the \u201cfeathered mound.\u201d] The party said they would retrieve the items after they visit the Dreedasesh estate to collect the Crimson Stone of Power found there. Aleashia said she felt healthy enough despite the malformed limb that was going to be a problem. She confided in Elinor that Olgann said he was trying to work out a magical solution. She wasn\u2019t supposed to tell anyone, or get her hopes up, because he wasn\u2019t sure it could be pulled off. After collecting Dronaste, Gwyn used Wind Traveler on the party to make it about half way back to the trail behind Strolbreln Tower . They spent the night in the magical hut. The next morning at dawn they used Wind Traveler again to make it the rest of the way. Danger Incorporated landed about 100 yards down the trail past the Strolbreln Tower . Info The players (and characters) spent a lot of time talking about what they know and what their plans are for going forward. The DM also clarified some information, including that Elinor is academically familiar with the 4 Volgo Houses and specifically the House of Silver from her entertainer days.

We\u2019re now in a 35\u2019 tall cavern, littered with the bones of dwarves, elves, etc. Hanne is set on getting an egg. We aid up. - Hanne - Kereshi - Elinor The ceiling of the next cavern is 80\u2019 high. There are 7 clusters of purple worm eggs, each cluster of eggs has 6 eggs. \u201cWe can climb up there\u201d - Hanne, and then she does.

Zorra addresses the hobgoblin to request an audience with [[Solral Dreedasesh]], the hobgoblin sends the primitive guy away with a message. We wait around for 10 or so minutes for the messenger to return. Zorra informs us that we were specifically warned to not draw steel. Dreedasesh estate == the Dark Oasis There\u2019s a barn with some nets on either end. 1 net has a bunch of spider webs. There\u2019s a giant lizard perched on the wall.

During the exchange between Solral and Elinor, Torrelli (privately) mentions their \u201csimian problem\u201d and suggests that we might be able to help (in Elvish). Gwyn overhears and addresses them, also in Elvish. Master Rujin controls Kuzuku forest and stole a precious item from the lady. He\u2019s privately admitted to taking this thing. He claims he would return it if Lady Dreedasesh actively supports him. Due to the nature of the dispute, she is hesitant to help. He took a spider figurine. Lady Dreedasesh sends Enyo over to help us. He\u2019s serving the Lady as an indentured servant. Dwarf, wearing chainmail. If we take Enyo with us, and get her into the pyramid, she can use \u201cLocate Object\u201d Gwyn gave up the egg to make up for being a doodoo head and admitting to listening in. Zorra and Viconia were talking off to the side, Gwyn was able to catch that Viconia is missing Grinvah. Enyo had joined the Battle Mage Assembly, she hails from Bhamboldir. The city fell in the Northern Invasion . She ran off with Jason Humperfull to join the Battle Mage assembly to get away from farming. SLD stands for \u201cSage of Life and Death\u201d - brokers of knowledge. Enyo was partners with Henry, and did a lot of work with the SLD. Henry got himself into a position trying to deceive Lady Solral, and he was caught. Enyo became an indentured servant. Khereshi knew Jason Vogel :O Elinor stole some letter in her life previously Fuzula and Lem came from a village where people were disappearing and coming back as vampires, so they noped out.","title":"001-20221004"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/065-20221004/#065-20221004","text":"Info campaign:: SumonHo date:: 2022-10-04 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: Don Warnecke Last Session: [[undefined]] Info ^summary","title":"065-20221004"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/065-20221004/#session-log","text":"We begin the session right outside of the estate.

Blue & green shawl, dress of blacks and browns - lady dreedasesh oldest daughter drow - reddish shawl and scowling - brizxae younger drow - black shawl, with some spiders and webs embroidered - viconia Consort Torrelli - mean looking drow that was sizing us up Lady Dreedasesh is never \u201cmy Lady\u201d Torrelli eats a mushroom, then offers one to the Lady, her daughter, and then offers one to Elinor, then Fuzula, then Kereshi - then set the mushrooms to the side (avoiding offering any to me) Zorra informs Solral how we saved her daughter, and the events that led up to this point. During the exchange between Solral and Elinor, Torrelli (privately) mentions their \u201csimian problem\u201d and suggests that we might be able to help (in Elvish). Gwyn overhears and addresses them, also in Elvish. Master Rujin controls Kuzuku forest and stole a precious item from the lady. He\u2019s privately admitted to taking this thing. He claims he would return it if Lady Dreedasesh actively supports him. Due to the nature of the dispute, she is hesitant to help. He took a spider figurine. Lady Dreedasesh sends Enyo over to help us. He\u2019s serving the Lady as an indentured servant. Dwarf, wearing chainmail. If we take Enyo with us, and get her into the pyramid, she can use \u201cLocate Object\u201d Gwyn gave up the egg to make up for being a doodoo head and admitting to listening in. Zorra and Viconia were talking off to the side, Gwyn was able to catch that Viconia is missing Grinvah. Enyo had joined the Battle Mage Assembly, she hails from Bhamboldir. The city fell in the Northern Invasion . She ran off with Jason Humperfull to join the Battle Mage assembly to get away from farming. SLD stands for \u201cSage of Life and Death\u201d - brokers of knowledge. Enyo was partners with Henry, and did a lot of work with the SLD. Henry got himself into a position trying to deceive Lady Solral, and he was caught. Enyo became an indentured servant. Khereshi knew Jason Vogel :O Elinor stole some letter in her life previously Fuzula and Lem came from a village where people were disappearing and coming back as vampires, so they noped out.","title":"Session Log"},{"location":"Campaigns/Scalinea/Session%20Notes/066-20221011/","tags":["ttrpg/session/SumonHo"],"text":"066-20221011 Info campaign:: SumonHo date:: 2022-10-11 type:: session, ttrpg dm:: Don Warnecke Last Session: 065-20221004 Info ^summary Scaleinea - Campaigns - D&D Beyond (dndbeyond.com) Session Log We head back to the Tee in the map to take a long rest.

About 90 minutes from the forest, we encounter a dwarfish looking fellow with a \"crown\" of wood/bark, wearing a short sword, blue skin and white hair. Fuzula addresses him, and he calls out \"SHOW YOURSELF\", since she's essentially invisible (gloomstalker) Calls himself The Great and Terrible Acid Bath, The Black Dragon. We let him pass, well, other than Fuzula poking him, and Kereshi standing in his way. Kereshi gets knocked on her ass by The Great and Terrible Acid Bath, and we turn to make our way towards the \"forest\" Another 90 minutes on the trail, we reach Kuzuku Forest, and Dranaste warns us again.

After our rest, we all make our way into Kuzuku, maintaining about a 5' between us. Dranaste and Fuzula essentially disappeared (39 and 35 for their stealth checks). While sneaking, - we see creatures that look like baboons, but they're taller with longer fangs and less hair than the above ground creatures, they were dead and in most cases were partially eaten - in one of the trees we see what some might call a Giant Ape (12' tall) in a tree - on a number of occassions we hear the rustling of underdark baboons in the underbrush After about an hour, we see a pyramid, with very steep sides (closer to vertical) and a flat top.

The Open Lord of Waterdeep (also called the \"Unmasked Lord\") was the sole member of the Lords of Waterdeep whose identity was publicly known. They held a number of additional titles including Warden of Waterdeep, Overmaster of the Guilds, and Commander of the Watch. The Open Lord was also the city's chief diplomat. There was only one Open Lord at any one time, but when the previous one died or stepped down, they were replaced by a new one. There were seven Open Lords of Waterdeep to 1489 DR; Ahghairon the Mage Baeron Silmaeril Lhestyn the Masked Lady Piergeiron the Paladinson Caladorn Cassalanter Dagult Neverember Lady Laeral Silverhand The Lords of Waterdeep were only seen in public when sitting in the Lord's Court or when appearing each year at Shieldmeet Council when the Lord's Rule is reaffirmed. The identities of the Lords, other than the Open Lord, were not supposed to be known to the public, although they were known to each other. The intent of this was to ensure that the Lords were free of coercion and could be drawn from any social strata within the city. While the masked Lords were considered to be equal to the Open Lord in authority, some executive authority was reserved for the Open Lord, including the vetting and selection of new Lords, the naming of the next Open Lord, and determining the needed number of Lords. Membership Open Lord: Laeral Silverhand Masked Lords: - Durnan - retired former adventurer and current proprietor of The Yawning Portal - [[Jelen Umbrusk]] - [[Mirt the Moneylender]] - a wealthy former adventurer that delved into [[Undermountain]] and found enough success and influence as a trader to become a masked lord of the city. - [[Corylus Thann]] - nobleman that employed the [[Zhentarim]] to violently prevent non-humans from achieving positions of power in Waterdeep and was in turn blackmailed by the Black Network. - [[Nazra Mays]] - spymaster (alleged)","title":"Lords of Waterdeep"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Lords%20of%20Waterdeep/#lords-of-waterdeep","text":"Info campaign:: [[32.01 DotMM]] setting:: Forgotten Realms leader:: Laeral Silverhand related:: Waterdeep , [[Harpers]], [[Lords Alliance]], [[Shadow Thieves]], [[Knights of the Shield]], [[Confluence]] externalLink:: https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lords_of_Waterdeep type:: faction, ttrpg, government","title":"Lords of Waterdeep"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Lords%20of%20Waterdeep/#description","text":"The Lords of Waterdeep were the mysterious and predominantly anonymous ruling council of Waterdeep , having governed the city from the 11th century onwards.

There were seven Open Lords of Waterdeep to 1489 DR; Ahghairon the Mage Baeron Silmaeril Lhestyn the Masked Lady Piergeiron the Paladinson Caladorn Cassalanter Dagult Neverember Lady Laeral Silverhand The Lords of Waterdeep were only seen in public when sitting in the Lord's Court or when appearing each year at Shieldmeet Council when the Lord's Rule is reaffirmed. The identities of the Lords, other than the Open Lord, were not supposed to be known to the public, although they were known to each other. The intent of this was to ensure that the Lords were free of coercion and could be drawn from any social strata within the city. While the masked Lords were considered to be equal to the Open Lord in authority, some executive authority was reserved for the Open Lord, including the vetting and selection of new Lords, the naming of the next Open Lord, and determining the needed number of Lords.","title":"Open Lord"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Lords%20of%20Waterdeep/#membership","text":"Open Lord: Laeral Silverhand Masked Lords: - Durnan - retired former adventurer and current proprietor of The Yawning Portal - [[Jelen Umbrusk]] - [[Mirt the Moneylender]] - a wealthy former adventurer that delved into [[Undermountain]] and found enough success and influence as a trader to become a masked lord of the city. - [[Corylus Thann]] - nobleman that employed the [[Zhentarim]] to violently prevent non-humans from achieving positions of power in Waterdeep and was in turn blackmailed by the Black Network. - [[Nazra Mays]] - spymaster (alleged)","title":"Membership"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Lords%27%20Alliance/","text":"Lords' Alliance Info campaign:: [[32.01 DotMM]] setting:: Forgotten Realms leader:: related:: externalLink:: type:: faction, ttrpg Description Purpose/Goals Organization Membership Laeral Silverhand","title":"Lord's Alliance"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Lords%27%20Alliance/#lords-alliance","text":"Info campaign:: [[32.01 DotMM]] setting:: Forgotten Realms leader:: related:: externalLink:: type:: faction, ttrpg","title":"Lords' Alliance"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Lords%27%20Alliance/#description","text":"","title":"Description"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Lords%27%20Alliance/#purposegoals","text":"","title":"Purpose/Goals"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Lords%27%20Alliance/#organization","text":"","title":"Organization"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Lords%27%20Alliance/#membership","text":"Laeral Silverhand","title":"Membership"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Mountain%20Sanctuary/","tags":["ttrpg/campaign/sumonho","ttrpg/setting/scalinea/faction/mountain-sanctuary"],"text":"Mountain Sanctuary FactionLeader:: Hun-Hoksa FactionType::Cult Notes Motto Purpose/Goals Description Members TABLE type AS Type, person.status AS Status FROM #ttrpg WHERE contains(factions, \"Mountain Sanctuary\") SORT person.status asc","title":"Mountain Sanctuary"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Mountain%20Sanctuary/#mountain-sanctuary","text":"FactionLeader:: Hun-Hoksa FactionType::Cult","title":"Mountain Sanctuary"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Mountain%20Sanctuary/#notes","text":"","title":"Notes"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Mountain%20Sanctuary/#motto","text":"","title":"Motto"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Mountain%20Sanctuary/#purposegoals","text":"","title":"Purpose/Goals"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Mountain%20Sanctuary/#description","text":"","title":"Description"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Mountain%20Sanctuary/#members","text":"TABLE type AS Type, person.status AS Status FROM #ttrpg WHERE contains(factions, \"Mountain Sanctuary\") SORT person.status asc","title":"Members"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Northern%20Army/","tags":["ttrpg/campaign/sumonho","ttrpg/setting/scalinea/faction/northern-army"],"text":"Northern Army FactionLeader:: FactionType::Military Notes Motto Purpose/Goals Description Members TABLE type AS Type, person.status AS Status FROM #ttrpg WHERE contains(factions, \"Northern Army\") SORT person.status asc","title":"Northern Army"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Northern%20Army/#northern-army","text":"FactionLeader:: FactionType::Military","title":"Northern Army"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Northern%20Army/#notes","text":"","title":"Notes"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Northern%20Army/#motto","text":"","title":"Motto"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Northern%20Army/#purposegoals","text":"","title":"Purpose/Goals"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Northern%20Army/#description","text":"","title":"Description"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Northern%20Army/#members","text":"TABLE type AS Type, person.status AS Status FROM #ttrpg WHERE contains(factions, \"Northern Army\") SORT person.status asc","title":"Members"},{"location":"Compendium/Factions/Peacekeepers/","tags":["ttrpg/campaign/sumonho","ttrpg/setting/scalinea/faction/peacekeepers"],"text":"Peacekeepers FactionLeader:: FactionType:: Notes Motto Purpose/Goals Description The Aimesland Peacekeepers is the force that respond to criminal acts and maintains order.

During the [[Siege on Sakatha\u2019s Stronghold ]] (1087 DR), [[Thorley Aldwulf]] distinguished himself among the rest of the fighting force by finding and exploiting a weakness in the wall around Sakatha \u2019s fortress in [[The Evermoors]]. Thorley led a small contingent of men on a scouting mission to try to find where Sakatha \u2019s forces were bringing supplies in. During this scouting mission a partially submerged tunnel was spotted. Thorley and these men cleared the tunnel entrance, and were able to gain entrance to Sakatha \u2019s stronghold. Thorley and his men opened up a gate, allowing the larger force led by [[Sigeweard Brunis]] to enter the compound. This single act directly led to the destruction of Sakatha . After Sakatha fell, Sigeweard was made a count. His first action as count was to make Thorley a baron in recognition of his contribution to freeing the land from the Lizard King\u2019s evil grip.

During this time, Barthen's Provisions also struck deals to sell dry goods and supplies to logging operations run by [[Tibor Wester]], the half-brother of Townmaster [[Harbin Wester]], as well as deals to sell herds of giant goats on behalf of [[Dagult Neverember]] in order to fund rebuilding efforts in Leilon. Sometime in late 1495 DR or early 1496 DR, the company went out of business.

Cave Mouth The trail from the goblin ambush site leads to the entrance of the Cragmaw hideout. collapse: open Following the goblins\u2019 trail, you come across a large cave in a hillside five miles from the scene of the ambush. A shallow stream flows out of the cave mouth, which is screened by dense briar thickets. A narrow dry path leads into the cave on the right-hand side of the stream. The thicket in area 2 is impenetrable from the west side of the stream. Developments The goblins in area 2 are supposed to be keeping watch on this area, but they are not paying attention. (Goblins can be lazy that way.) However, if the characters make a lot of noise here\u2014for example, loudly arguing about what to do next, setting up a camp, cutting down brush, and so on\u2014the goblins in area 2 notice and attack them through the thicket, which provides the goblins with half cover (see [[08.combat#Cover]] for rules on cover). 2. Goblin Blind When the characters cross to the east side of the stream, they can see around the screening thickets to area 2. This is a goblin guard post, though the goblins here are bored and inattentive. collapse: open On the east side of the stream flowing from the cave mouth, a small area in the briar thickets has been hollowed out to form a lookout post or blind. Wooden planks flatten out the briars and provide room for guards to lie hidden and watch the area\u2014including a pair of goblins lurking there right now! Two goblins are stationed here. If the goblins notice intruders in area 1, they open fire with their bows, shooting through the thickets and probably catching the characters by surprise. If the goblins don\u2019t notice the adventurers in area 1, they spot them when they splash across the stream, and neither side is surprised. Characters moving carefully or scouting ahead might be able to surprise the goblin lookouts. Have each character who moves ahead make a Dexterity check contested by the goblins\u2019 passive Wisdom score to avoid being surprised. See Ability Checks for more information on ability check contests. Thickets. The thickets around the clearing are difficult terrain, but they aren\u2019t dangerous\u2014just annoying. They provide half cover to creatures behind them. (See \u201cDifficult Terrain\u201d and \u201cCover\u201d in the Basic Rules for more information.) 3. Kennel The Cragmaws keep a kennel of foul-tempered wolves that they are training for battle. collapse: open Just inside the cave mouth, a few uneven stone steps lead up to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end, and is filled with the stench of animals. Savage snarls and the sounds of rattling chains greet your ears where three wolves are chained up just inside the opening. Each wolf\u2019s chain leads to an iron rod driven into the base of a stalagmite. Three [wolves]( Wolf - Monsters - D&D Beyond (dndbeyond.com) are confined here. They can\u2019t reach targets standing on the steps, but all three attack any creature except a goblin that moves into the room (see the Cragmaw Hideout#Developments section). Goblins in nearby caves ignore the sounds of fighting wolves, since they constantly snap and snarl at each other. A character who tries to calm the animals can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom ([[06.abilities#^2b6fcb|Animal Handling]]) check. On a success, the wolves allow the character to move throughout the room. If the wolves are given food, the DC drops to 10. Fissure. A narrow opening in the east wall leads to a natural chimney that climbs 30 feet to area 8. At the base of the fissure is rubbish that\u2019s been discarded through the opening above. A character attempting to ascend or descend the chimney shaft must make a DC 10 Strength ([[06.abilities#Strength Checks|Athletics]]) check. If the check succeeds, the character moves at half speed up or down the shaft, as desired. On a check result of 6\u20139, the character neither gains nor loses ground; on a result of 5 or less, the character falls and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing [[11.gamemastering#Prone]] at the base of the shaft. Developments If the wolves are goaded by enemies beyond their reach, they are driven into a frenzy that allows them to yank the iron rod securing their chains out of the floor. Each round that any character remains in sight, the wolves attempt a single DC 15 Strength check. On the first success, they loosen the rod and the DC drops to 10. On a second success, they yank the rod loose, bending it so that their chains are freed. A goblin or [[bugbear]] can use its action to release one [[wolf]] from its chain. 4. Steep Passage From this point on, characters without [[07.adventuring#Darkvision]] will need light to see their surroundings. The main passage from the cave mouth climbs steeply upward, the stream plunging and splashing down its west side. In the shadows, a side passage leads west across the other side of the stream. Characters using light or darkvision to look farther up the passage spot the bridge at area 5. Add: In the shadows of the ceiling to the north, you can just make out the dim shape of a rickety bridge of wood and rope crossing over the passage ahead of you. Another passage intersects this one, twenty feet above the floor. Any character who can see the bridge in area 5 might also notice the goblin guarding the bridge. Doing so requires a Wisdom ([[06.abilities#^f1f005|Perception]]) check contested by the goblin \u2019s Dexterity ([[06.abilities#^6743c3|Stealth]]) check. The goblin notices the characters if they carry any light or don\u2019t use stealth as they approach the bridge. The goblin does not attack. Instead, it attempts to sneak away to the east to inform its companions in area 7 to release a flood (see the \u201c Cragmaw Hideout#Flood \u201d section of area 5). The goblin moves undetected if its Dexterity ([[06.abilities#^6743c3|Stealth]]) check exceeds the passive Wisdom ([[06.abilities#^f1f005|Perception]]) score of any character who might notice its movements. Western Passage. This passage is choked with rubble and has steep escarpments. Treat the area as difficult terrain (see \u201c[[07.adventuring#Difficult Terrain]]\" in the Basic Rules). The ledge between the two escarpments is fragile. Any weight in excess of 100 pounds loosens the whole mass and sends it tumbling down to the east. Any creature on the ledge when it falls must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. The creature also falls [[11.gamemastering#Prone]] on a failed save. 5. Overpass Where a high tunnel passes through the larger tunnel cavern below, the goblins have set up a bridge guard post. The stream passage continues up beyond another set of uneven steps ahead, bending eastward as it goes. A waterfall sounds out from a larger cavern somewhere ahead of you. If the characters didn\u2019t spot the bridge while navigating area 4, they spot it now. Add: A rickety bridge spans the passage, connecting two tunnels that are 20 feet above the stream. One [[13.monsters#Goblin|goblin]] stands watch on the bridge. It is hiding, and characters can spot it by succeeding on a Wisdom ([[06.abilities#^f1f005|Perception]]) check contested by the goblin\u2019s Dexterity ([[06.abilities#^6743c3]]) check. This guard is lazy and inattentive. If no characters are using light sources, each character can attempt a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the goblin\u2019s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to creep by without being noticed. If the [[13.monsters#Goblin|goblin]] spots the adventurers, it signals the goblins in area 7 to release a flood (see the \u201c Cragmaw Hideout#Flood \" section), then fire arrows down at the characters. Bridge. This bridge spans the passage 20 feet above the stream. It\u2019s possible to climb up the cavern walls from the lower passage to the bridge. The 20-foot-high walls are rough but slick with spray, requiring a successful DC 15 Strength ([[06.abilities#Strength Checks|Athletics]]) check to climb. The bridge has an Armor Class (AC) of 5 and 10 hit points. If the bridge is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses. Creatures on the collapsing bridge must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing [[11.gamemastering#Prone]]. Those who succeed hold onto the bridge and must climb it to safety. Flood! The large pools in area 7 have collapsible walls that can be yanked out of place to release a surge of water down the main passage of the lair. In the round after the goblins in area 7 are signaled by the lookout in area 5, they start knocking away the supports. In the following round on the goblins\u2019 initiative count, a water surge pours from area 7 down to area 1. The passage is suddenly filled with a mighty roar, as a huge surge of rushing water pours down from above! The flood threatens all creatures in the tunnel. (Creatures on the bridge at area 5 are out of danger, as are any characters successfully climbing the cavern walls.) Any creature within 10 feet of the disused passage at area 4 or the steps leading up to area 3 can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being swept away. A creature that fails to get out of the way can attempt a DC 15 Strength saving throw to hold on. On a failed save, the character is knocked [[11.gamemastering#Prone]] and washed down to area 1, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage along the way. The goblins in area 7 can release a second flood by opening the second pool, but they don\u2019t do this unless the goblin on the bridge tells them to. The goblin on the bridge waits to see if the first flood got rid of all the intruders before calling for the second to be released. 6. Goblin Den The Cragmaw raiders stationed in the hideout use this area as a common room and barracks. Info This large cave is divided in half by a ten-foot-high escarpment. A steep natural staircase leads from the lower portion to the upper ledge. The air is hazy with the smoke of a cooking fire, and pungent from the smell of poorly cured hides and unwashed goblins. Six [[13.monsters#Goblin|goblins]] inhabit this den, and one of them is a leader with 12 hit points. The five ordinary goblins tend the cooking fire in the lower (northern) part of the cave near the entrance passage, while the leader rests in the upper (southern) part of the cave. Sildar Hallwinter , a human warrior, is held prisoner in this chamber. He is securely bound on the southern ledge of the cavern. The goblins have been beating and tormenting him, so he is weak and at 1 hit point. The goblin leader, [[13.monsters#Goblin|Yeemik]], is second-in-command of the whole hideout. If he sees that the characters are getting the upper hand, he grabs Sildar and drags him over to the edge of the upper level. \u201cTruce, or this human dies!\u201d he shouts. Yeemik wants to oust Klarg and become the new boss. If the adventurers agree to parley, Yeemik tries to convince them to kill Klarg in area 8, promising to release Sildar when they bring back the bugbear\u2019s head. Sildar groggily warns the characters that they shouldn\u2019t trust the goblin, and he\u2019s right. If the characters take the deal, Yeemik tries to force them to pay a rich ransom for Sildar even after they complete their part of the bargain. If the characters refuse to parley, Yeemik shoves Sildar over the edge and continues with the fight. Sildar takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall, which is enough to drop him to 0 hit points. Quick-acting characters can try to stabilize him before he dies (see \u201c[[08.combat#Damage and Healing]]\u201d in the Basic Rules). Roleplaying Sildar Sildar Hallwinter is a kindhearted human male of nearly fifty years who holds a place of honor in the famous griffon cavalry of the great city of Waterdeep. He is an agent of the Lords\u2019 Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Members of the order ensure the safety of cities and other settlements by proactively eliminating threats by any means, while bringing honor and glory to their leaders and homelands. Sildar met Gundren Rockseeker in [[Neverwinter]] and agreed to accompany him back to Phandalin . Sildar wants to investigate the fate of Iarno Albrek, a human wizard and fellow member of the Lords\u2019 Alliance who disappeared shortly after arriving in Phandalin . Sildar hopes to learn what happened to Iarno, assist Gundren in reopening the old mine, and help restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity. Sildar provides the characters with four pieces of useful information: The three Rockseeker brothers ( Gundren , [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]], and Nundro ) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver\u2019s Pact. Info More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver\u2019s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge (called the Forge of Spells), where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin (pronounced fan -duh-lin) prospered as well. But then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path. A powerful force of orcs reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost. [[13.monsters#Bugbear|Klarg]], the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn\u2019t know who or what the The Black Spider is. Gundren had a map showing the secret location of [[Wave Echo Cave]], but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes that [[Klarg]] sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called [[Cragmaw Castle]]. Sildar doesn\u2019t know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know. (It doesn\u2019t occur to Sildar immediately, but a captured goblin might also be persuaded to divulge the castle\u2019s location. See the \u201cWhat the Goblins Know\u201d sidebar above.) Sildar\u2019s contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named [[Iarno Albrek]]. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the [[Lords\u2019 Alliance]] received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate. Sildar tells the characters that he intends to continue on to Phandalin , since it\u2019s the nearest settlement. He offers to pay the party 50 gp to provide escort. Although he has no money on him, Sildar can secure a loan to pay the characters within a day after arriving in Phandalin. First, he hopes they\u2019ll put a stop to the goblin raids by clearing out the caves. Developments If he is rescued and healed, Sildar Hallwinter remains with the party but is anxious to reach Phandalin as quickly as possible. He doesn\u2019t have any weapons or armor, but he can take a shortsword from a defeated goblin or use a weapon loaned to him by a character. If Sildar joins the party, see the \u201cNPC Party Members\u201d sidebar for tips on how to run him. Treasure title: Treasure Yeemik carries a pouch containing three gold teeth (1 gp each) and 15 sp. Sildar\u2019s gear, along with Gundren Rockseeker, was taken to Cragmaw Castle. 7. Twin Pools Cave If the [[13.monsters#Goblin|goblins]] have drained either pool to flood the passage, adjust the following boxed text accordingly. This cavern is half filled with two large pools of water. A narrow waterfall high in the eastern wall feeds the pool, which drains out the western end of the chamber to form the stream that flows out of the cave mouth below. Low fieldstone walls serve as dams holding the water in. A wide exit stands to the south, while two smaller passages lead west. The sound of the waterfall echoes through the cavern, making it difficult to hear. Three [[13.monsters#Goblin|goblins]] guard this cave. If the goblin in area 5 spotted the characters and warned the goblins here, they are ready for trouble. The noise of the waterfall means that the creatures in area 8 can\u2019t hear any fighting that takes place here, and vice versa. Therefore, as soon as a fight breaks out here, one goblin flees to area 8 to warn Klarg. Rock Dams. The goblins built simple dams to control the flow of water through the heart of the complex. If the goblin sentry in area 5 has called for the goblins here to release a flood, one or both of the pools are mostly empty and the stream is flowing unimpeded. 8. Klarg's Cave The leader of the goblinoids insists on keeping the bulk of the raiders\u2019 stolen goods in his den. The Cragmaws\u2019 plunder from the last month of raiding and ambushing caravans is here. Sacks and crates of looted provisions are piled up in the south end of this large cave. To the west, the floor slopes toward a narrow opening that descends into darkness. A larger opening leads north down a set of natural stone steps, the roar of falling water echoing from beyond. In the middle of the cavern, the coals of a large fire smolder. Klarg the [[13.monsters#Bugbear]] shares this cave with his mangy pet [[14.creatures#Wolf]], Ripper, and two [[13.monsters#Goblin|goblins]]. The bugbear is filled with delusions of grandeur and views himself as a mighty warlord just beginning his career of conquest. He is not entirely sane, referring to himself in the third person (\u201cWho dares defy Klarg?\u201d or \u201cKlarg will build a throne from your bones, puny ones!\u201d). The goblins under his command resent his bullying. Fire Pit. The hot coals in the central fire pit deal 1 fire damage to any creature that enters the fire pit, or 1d6 fire damage to any creature that falls prone there. A creature can take each type of damage only once per round. Natural Chimney. A niche in the western wall forms the top of a shaft that descends 30 feet to area 3. See that area for information on climbing the natural chimney. Supplies. The piles of sacks and crates can provide half cover to any creature fighting or hiding behind them. Most are marked with the image of a blue lion\u2014the symbol of the Lionshield Coster, a merchant company with a warehouse and trading post in Phandalin. Hidden among the supplies is an unlocked treasure chest belonging to Klarg (see the \u201cTreasure\u201d section). Any character who searches the supplies finds the chest. Developments If Klarg is warned by the goblins in area 7 that the hideout is under attack, he and his wolf hide behind stalagmites while the goblins take cover behind the piles of supplies, hoping to ambush the characters when they enter the cave. If Klarg and company are not warned about possible attackers, the characters have a good chance to surprise them. The easiest way for the characters to achieve this is to climb the chimney from area 3, since Klarg does not expect an attack from that direction. If the wolf is killed, the bugbear attempts to climb down the chimney to area 3 and flee the cave complex. Treasure title: Treasure The captured stores are bulky, and the characters will need a wagon to transport them. If they return the supplies to the [Lionshield Coster](../Factions/Lionshield Coster.md) in [Phandalin](./Phandalin.md), they earn a reward of 50 gp and the friendship of Linene and her company. In addition to the stolen provisions, Klarg has a treasure chest that contains 600 cp, 110 sp, two [potions of healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/potion-of-healing), and a jade statuette of a frog with tiny golden orbs for eyes (40 gp). The frog statuette is small enough to fit in a pocket or pouch.","title":"Cragmaw Hideout"},{"location":"Compendium/Geography/Cragmaw%20Hideout/#cragmaw-hideout","text":"Campaign:: [[32.00 AotR]] Setting:: [[Forgotten Realms]] GovernmentType:: NotableNPCs::","title":"Cragmaw Hideout"},{"location":"Compendium/Geography/Cragmaw%20Hideout/#description","text":"id: cragmaw-hideout image: - [map-cragmaw-hideout.png](../../assets/images/Maps/map-cragmaw-hideout.png) - [map-cragmaw-hideout-player.png](../../assets/images/Maps/map-cragmaw-hideout-player.png) bounds: [[0,0],[104.20,149.59]] height: 500px unit: ft lat: 50 long: 50 minZoom: 1 maxZoom: 8.3 defaultzoom: 7","title":"Description"},{"location":"Compendium/Geography/Cragmaw%20Hideout/#1-cave-mouth","text":"The trail from the goblin ambush site leads to the entrance of the Cragmaw hideout. collapse: open Following the goblins\u2019 trail, you come across a large cave in a hillside five miles from the scene of the ambush.

The easiest way for the characters to achieve this is to climb the chimney from area 3, since Klarg does not expect an attack from that direction.

It is a small town in the foothills leading up to the Barrier Mountains , in a region called kosketus taivas. Many of the inhabitants farm potatoes, wheat, and barley. The village proper is made up of 8 buildings. Four businesses serve the resident\u2019s needs; a general store, a blacksmith, a tavern, and a butcher\u2019s shop. Two businesses serve primarily other businesses; the mill (wind mill) and the 4-stall stables. Also, two buildings meet the religious needs; the Kalevala temple and the disease-ward shrine dedicated to Kiputytto. The Kalevala temple is a sturdy, defensible building with 3 levels; 2 indoors and 1 outdoors. The Kalevala temple is ministered primarily by the churches of Rondos (1 priestess and 1 deacon) and Ilmatar (1 cleric and 1 deacon), with a resident priest of Yipen and a visiting cleric of Aino. The Templars and faithful guards also perform lite patrols of the town. This includes 2 Rondos Templars, 2 Aino Templars, 1 Ilmatar Templar, 4 Rondos guards, 2 Yipen guards, and 1 Ilmatar guard. The Aino cleric and templars have been in Rainsburg intermittently over the last 2 years. Entering the double doors with raised portcullis on the front (southern side) of the building, a visitor would walk up the stairs toward the main worship area. The main worship area has several 4x6 windows (with bars) that can be closed by releasing the rope. There are also 2 smaller worship rooms. There are a man-sized doors on both the east and west side of the building that open into a curved hallway to another metal door. Two trap doors on the 2nd floor lead to the open-aired 3rd floor, which has an attractive but functional 3.5 foot tall wall and a roof. This building is the location that the populace would run to in the event of an emergency. The shrine is a small 12x20 building with 2 rooms maintained by a local citizen. It represents an attempt to ward off citizen and crop diseases.

Mid term: - ? Long term: - ? Notes Background As a child, I was cursed by a hag. My parents desperately wanted a child but were unable to conceive. They made a deal with a hag that lived in a swamp near my village - my mother would be found with child, and in return, they would owe the hag a favor. An obviously poor deal, but when desperate, any chance at happiness seems worth the cost. After I was born, my father spent his free time trying to find a way to break the pact with the hag. In the end, he was successful, though it cost him an eye in the exchange. The hag was furious and cursed me to die on my 23rd birthday. For my part, I dedicated my short life to learning as much about the world as I could. During my 8th summer, a traveling band of gnomish tinkers came through the village. I was enthralled with everything I could learn about their custom. I still remember how foreign and wonderful it seemed to me when I first saw them greet each other - the men would kiss the hand of the women, and their handshakes were always done with intense eye contact and grasping the forearm of the other man. In my 16th year, I set out from the village to learn all that I could about the world. I promised my parents I would return before my 23rd birthday, packed a bag, and set off. While travelling, I happened about a clan of Fey in a forest, or they happened upon me. I was lost and had run out of water. Dehydrated and emaciated, they nursed me back to health. I was with them for a year, and in that time did all that I could to learn their customs and be as useful to them as I could be. During that year, the medicine woman learned of my curse, and she worked with the elders of the community to create a ritual to try to rid me of my curse. While the ritual was ultimately successful, they misjudged the strength of the curse, and breaking it was not without repercussion. The medicine woman and I were both killed. As my soul was leaving my body the sorrow that I felt for the damage that I caused and that I'd denied my parents the ability to see me once more before I died caused my soul to linger. During this time an Archfey appeared to me. He made a deal with me - my life and a bit of his power in exchange for a favor. I took it. I guess I'm my father's daughter afterall. These days I make my own luck, and let fate take me where it will, doing my best to help those that can't help themselves.

His desire is to help people, not hurt people. Therefore, he tends to get defensive assignments like guard duty or acting as a body guard for a member of the clergy when in town. An enterprising half-elven priest befriended and recruited him to the cause. Although not highly intelligent, Tsakor has a knack for strategy as well as brute force. He can sometimes fall back to pure might and intimidation when frustrated, but he does not mindlessly charge his team into the fray. Tsakor's cover name is Drakur \"the Maul\" Rumblestrike. He rarely uses his cover name as Tsakor (the identity) is associated with his 'sell sword turned adventurer' persona. The Maul (the identity) is associated with this criminal persona. His residence and employment was at The Darkhouse before moving to Waterdeep , with all the secrecy that entails. His 'cover story' when interacting with people outside the church is that he free lances providing personal security for hire. In addition to his unoccupied saferoom in the Shadowhouse in Waterdeep , Tsakor stays in The Yawning Portal Inn located on Rainrun Street in Waterdeep . This is his launching point for adventures with his current companions, including Hani Wildheart . Tsakor has built an acquaintance with [[Balthorr Olaskos|Balthorr \u201cthe Bold\u201d Olaskos]] of [[Balthorr\u2019s Rare and Wondrous Treasures]]. Balthorr befriended Tsakor, granting him access to a contraband, fences, forgers, etc. Rather than all three traveling back through the portal, [[Freedom Operative]] [[Morton]] took the trip to report in to [[Bishop Ramon]] with all three reports. Four months later he returned with their new orders. [[Father Anthis]] is to establish a new church. Tsakor is to continue adventuring to provide financial support for the fledgling Church of Sutamo extension. At least 15% of all his acquired treasure will be turned over to the Church to fund operations.","title":"Tsakor"},{"location":"Compendium/People/Characters/Tsakor/#tsakor","text":"Current Goals Short Term: - Gain experience and capabilities. - See more of the world. - Acquire a darkness dagger - Find a way to quickly transfer between splint mail/plate armor (when he has some) and his breastplate when stealth is required. - A magic item to boost strength.

He possessed unusual demonic features and a scar on his chest in the shape of an enormous winged humanoid. Personality Ashardalon was regarded as a self-important dragon with an almost desperate attachment to his own life. He was willing to go through whatever means necessary to prevent his own death. History Ashardalon taking flight. After suffering a mortal wound, Ashardalon attempted to extend his life by binding a balor called Ammet to his chest in order to function as a second heart. However, his injuries were too extensive for the balor's power to keep Ashardalon alive. He then moved to a domain in the Astral Plane known as the Bastion of Unborn Souls and established his lair there. He was kept alive thanks to the timeless nature of the Astral Plane and the unusual flow of energy that permeated the Bastion. Rumors & Legends Ashardalon was rumored to be associated with a stronghold of the Cult of the Dragon located northwest of Thundertree]. The structure collapsed in the event of the eruption of Mount Hotenow in 1451 DR.

Tree Thralls If a humanoid is bound to the bole of the Gulthias Tree, over the next 24 hours the victim is sucked completely into the tree.

First, the Kalevala was very hero-centric work. Also, it was displaced in a mere 70 years of formal writing. While there was a wealth of material, it was not overwhelmingly so. This allowed me to flesh out the D&D mythos with historical gods, spirits, 3 gods from other mythos, and a few strictly fictitious godlings without contradicting well known beliefs. Ascension There is an ascension system in the religious system. The \u201cgods,\u201d more accurately described as deities, are made up of 3 levels of gods (greater god, lesser god, and demigod), 3 levels of godlings (higher godling, lower godling, and quasidiety), and 2 levels of heros (major and minor). Within each level, there are ranks. Beings gain power as they gain ranks. Ranks or generally gained by obtaining worshippers, believers, and followers. A godling is typically associated with a god that augments their ability to grant spells to their clerics. Heros cannot grant spells although their power can greatly exceed that of mortal men and women. There are no deities that originated on this [[world]]. There are a few heros that are along the path of ascension. Divine Relations Common forms The religious system is a polytheism. Individuals are not restricted to believing in or even worshipping a single deity. Churches often supported each other to the benefit of each other and their constituency. A chapel within a castle may be dedicated to multiple gods, or even the Kalevala Gods or the Gods of Despair (Pohjola). Several temples may be built in a single complex, allowing the clerics to provide a common defense/services and worshippers to efficiently give praise. The deities and their Churches are organized into 3 groups. Kalevala is made up primarily of good aligned. The Churches of these deities engage to protect people and make their lives better. The Gods of Despair is made up primarily of evil aligned. The Churches of these deities are focused on \u2018no holds barred\u2019 advocating for their parishioners. The Gods in Waiting tend to be Neutral with respect to the respect for life/dignity and willingness to kill with little qualms. They don\u2019t oppose either the Kalevala Gods or the Gods of Despair, oftentimes maintaining a positive relationship with both groups. They are often viewed as waiting to see who prevails, but are much more likely to have other values that they consider more important to be distracted by the battle between good and evil.

Archbishop, bishop, high priest, priest, and deacon. There is only one Archbishop. A high priest is responsible for a specific church or temple. Deacons are very limited in what rites they can perform. Clerics are the mortal might of their deities. While they are not necessarily combat oriented, they receive special gifts that are intended to be used in the service of their deity. They are rarely located at one particular building for extended periods of time rather going were duty calls; and this is often in the midst of struggle and conflict. While they often experience authority with followers of their deity and with Templars, they often operate outside of the authority structure found within individual churches. In some cases, clergy may even xxx clerics out of jealousy or the amount of autonomy they have within the Church. Temples and churches are protected by Templars. While Templars can be any class, they are often Honor Guard, Righteous Protectorate , or Holy Warriors (note: none of these classes have been built in 5e, in fact they would probably be archetypes or sacred oaths). Honor guard are closely aligned with paladins. Holy warriors are closely aligned with fighters. Righteous protectorates are a special class that can advance as offensive or defensive capabilities as they gain levels. Alignments: Honor Guard must be the alignment of the deity. Clerics and religious positions above priest are usually the same alignment. Righteous Protectorate must be the alignments that most closely align with their deity. Holy Warriors must be the non-neutral alignment of their deity. Dieties and their Churches Coari (some of this description comes from the Deities and Demigods 3rd edition) Quasidiety Symbol: Silhouette of a Woman or Sea Shell Home Plane: Olympus Alignment: CG Sympathetic alignments: CG, CN, NG Worshippers: Artists, lovers, bards, elves Sphere of Control: Lust, Beauty Domains (5e): Life Color: Violet Animal: Peacock Favorite Weapon: Dagger The deity of romantic love, sexual desire, and physical beauty, Coari embodies those ideals. She appears as a human woman of phenomenal beauty, dressed in a simple gown and adorned with jewelry. She is usually smiling and in fact is often called \u201csmile-loving\u201d or \u201claughter-loving Coari.\u201d Both Wainen and Otter are courting Coari, and she is greatly pleased by their rivalry. Coari is an element of Aphrodite of the Greek pantheon. Dogma: Coari embodies the joy of passion, freedom, and whimsy. Her brand of passion creates, and she celebrates the beauty of life in all forms. Laughter-loving Coari urges her followers to take whatever pleasure can be extracted from life without allowing social strictures to squelch their freedom, their creativity, or their passion. Though she promotes the ideals of good, she does not demand that anyone take up arms to promote it. Though her own actions have provoked great conflicts Aphrodite would prefer to see mortals make love rather than war. Clergy, Templars, and Temples: Aphrodite\u2019s clerics are matchmakers, dispensers of advice to the lovelorn, and general meddlers in other people\u2019s personal business. They are also prominent hedonists, seeking out every opportunity to enjoy what pleasures this [[world]] offers before moving on to the next. Most are gentle and peaceable, and few find any reason to adventure. Those that do adventure generally do so out of a belief that their actions can improve the [[world]], making it a more peaceful place where love and beauty ca flourish in the absence of violence and evil. Coari\u2019s temples are beautifully decorated with fine art and precious implements. They are usually found only in cities, though Coari herself is revered more broadly. Her Templars are not typically aggressive, unless necessary, and prefer to persuade and charm interlopers. Coari\u2019s temples are typically established in areas where they don\u2019t need exceptional protection and her followers make sure to maintain positive relations with those who can provide aid if needed. Code? Sutamo Quasidiety Symbol: Glossy Orb in Blackness Home Plane: Tarterus Alignment: CN Sympathetic alignments: CN, CE, tN Worshippers: Thieves, thugs, and assassins Sphere of Control: Darkness Domains (5e): Trickery Color: Jet Black Animal: Bat Favorite Weapon: Short Sword Sutamo appears a man in leathers and shroud in shadow. He is a powerful warrior; strong, agile, and skillful. No darkness can obscure his view. Dogma: Sutamo was a follower of Tuoni before his ascension. He is a powerful fighter, but emphasizes taking advantage of other skills as well. Sutamo does not believe that a fair fight is judged by equal Strength or awareness, rather he believes that a warrior should fight with all his available resources. Energy is spent on developing non-combat skills, so they should be available for a battle as well. Numerous rogues and thugs worship Sutamo, keeper of the night. Although Sutamo does not seek out such company, he does not discourage it either. Some assassins, primarily those that kill for reasons other than money, worship Sutamo as well. Clergy, Templars, and Temples: Sutamo\u2019s clerics and worshippers are not easy to recognize. They simply appear as hard-working citizens. Their few temples are often remote or well disguised. Most formal worship happens late at night, particularly during full moons. Code? Beliefs?
